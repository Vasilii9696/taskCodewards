Задача:
Theoretical Material
You are given two vectors starting from the origin (x=0, y=0) with coordinates (x1,y1) and (x2,y2). Your task is to find out if these vectors are collinear. Collinear vectors are vectors that lie on the same straight line. They can be directed in the same or opposite directions. One vector can be obtained from another by multiplying it by a certain number. In terms of coordinates, vectors (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are collinear if (x1, y1) = (k*x2, k*y2) , where k is any number acting as a coefficient.

For more information, check out this article on collinearity.
Problem Description
Write the function collinearity(x1, y1, x2, y2), which returns a Boolean type depending on whether the vectors are collinear or not.
all coordinates are integers
-1000 <= any coordinate <= 1000

Notes

All vectors start from the origin (x=0, y=0).
Be careful when handling cases where x1, x2, y1, or y2 are zero to avoid division by zero errors.
A vector with coordinates (0, 0) is collinear to all vectors.

Examples
(1,1,1,1) ➞ true
(1,2,2,4) ➞ true
(1,1,6,1) ➞ false
(1,2,-1,-2) ➞ true
(1,2,1,-2) ➞ false
(4,0,11,0) ➞ true
(0,1,6,0) ➞ false
(4,4,0,4) ➞ false
(0,0,0,0) ➞ true
(0,0,1,0) ➞ true

Задача:
Given two strings comprised of + and -, return a new string which shows how the two strings interact in the following way:

When positives and positives interact, they remain positive.
When negatives and negatives interact, they remain negative.
But when negatives and positives interact, they become neutral, and are shown as the number 0.

Worked Example
("+-+", "+--") ➞ "+-0"
# Compare the first characters of each string, then the next in turn.
# "+" against a "+" returns another "+".
# "-" against a "-" returns another "-".
# "+" against a "-" returns "0".
# Return the string of characters.

Examples
("--++--", "++--++") ➞ "000000"

("-+-+-+", "-+-+-+") ➞ "-+-+-+"

("-++-", "-+-+") ➞ "-+00"

Notes
The two strings will be the same length.

Задача:
Many programming languages provide the functionality of converting a string to uppercase or lowercase. For example, upcase/downcase in Ruby, upper/lower in Python, and toUpperCase/toLowerCase in Java/JavaScript, uppercase/lowercase in Kotlin.
Typically, these methods won't change the size of the string.
For example, in Ruby, str.upcase.downcase.size == str.size is true for most cases. 
However, in some special cases, the length of the transformed string may be longer than the original. Can you find a string that satisfies this criteria? 
For example, in Ruby, That means str.upcase.downcase.size > str.size
You should just set the value of STRANGE_STRING to meet the previous criteria.
Note: Meta programming is not allowed in this kata. So, the size of your solution is limited.

Задача:
Confusion, perplexity, a mild headache. These are just a sample of the things you have experienced in the last few minutes while trying to figure out what is going on in your code.
The task is very simple: accept a list of values, and another value n, then return a new list with every value multiplied by n. For example, [1, 2, 3] and 4 should result in [4, 8, 12].
While writing the function, you even added some debugging lines to make sure that you didn't mess anything up, and everything looked good! But for some reason when you run the function it always seems to return an empty list, even though you can clearly see, that the list should have the right values in it! Somehow, the values are simply disappearing! Is this a bug in the programming language itself...?

Task
Given a point in a Euclidean plane (x and y), return the quadrant the point exists in: 1, 2, 3 or 4 (integer). x and y are non-zero integers, therefore the given point never lies on the axes.
Examples
(1, 2)     => 1
(3, 5)     => 1
(-10, 100) => 2
(-1, -9)   => 3
(19, -56)  => 4

Reference


Quadrants

There are four quadrants:

First quadrant, the quadrant in the top-right, contains all points with positive X and Y
Second quadrant, the quadrant in the top-left, contains all points with negative X, but positive Y
Third quadrant, the quadrant in the bottom-left, contains all points with negative X and Y
Fourth quadrant, the quadrant in the bottom-right, contains all points with positive X, but negative Y

Задача:
If I were to ask you the size of "hello", what would you say?
Wait, let me rephrase the question:
If I were to ask you the total byte size of "hello", how many bytes do you think it takes up?
I'll give you a hint: it's not 5.
len("hello")  -->  5

byte size -->  54

54? What?!
Here's why: every string has to have an encoding (e.g ASCII),the info that makes it an object, as well as all of it's other properites... it would have to take up a bit more than 5 bytes, wouldn't it?
This might be useful for sending something over a network, where you need to represent the memory size the item takes up.

Task:
In this kata, you need to return the number of bytes (aka. memory size) a given object takes up. 
Different variable types will be given, but they will all be valid. Also, random generation for strings takes out of Unicode, not the regular 255 ascii letters.
p.s: Don't be afraid to use the internet. It "byte" come in handy :)
Other Examples:
Object    Bytes    Why?
----      ----     ---- 
"龘"       76      Other character sets take up more room.
123        28      Numbers don't have as much info in them. 
[1,2]      72      Lists have more info stored (e.g index).
(1,2)      56      Tuples are (kind of) just bowls of data.

Задача:
Introduction
floats have limited precision and are unable to exactly represent some values. Rounding errors accumulate with repeated computation, and numbers expected to be equal often differ slightly.
As a result, it is common advice to not use an exact equality comparison (==) with floats.
>>> a, b, c = 1e-9, 1e-9, 3.33e7
>>> (a + b) + c == a + (b + c)
False

>>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 1.0
False

a, b, c = 1e-9, 1e-9, 3.33e7;
(a + b) + c == a + (b + c);
--> false

0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 == 1.0;
--> false

The solution is to check if a computed value is close to an expected value, without requiring them to be exactly equal. It seems very easy, but many katas test float results the wrong way.
Task
You have:

a float value that comes from a computation and may have accumulated errors up to ±0.001
a reference value


a function approx_equals that compare the two values taking into account loss of precision; the function should return True if and only if the two values are close to each other, the maximum allowed difference is 0.001

The function is bugged and sometimes returns wrong results.
Your task is to correct the bug.
Note
This kata uses fixed tolerance for simplicity reasons, but usually relative tolerance is better. Fixed tolerance is useful for comparisons near zero or when the magnitude of the values is known.

Задача:
If you've completed this kata already and want a bigger challenge, here's the 3D version
Bob is bored during his physics lessons so he's built himself a toy box to help pass the time. The box is special because it has the ability to change gravity. 
There are some columns of toy cubes in the box arranged in a line. The i-th column contains a_i cubes. At first, the gravity in the box is pulling the cubes downwards. When Bob switches the gravity, it begins to pull all the cubes to a certain side of the box, d, which can be either 'L' or 'R' (left or right). Below is an example of what a box of cubes might look like before and after switching gravity.
+---+                                       +---+

+---++---++---++---+         +---++---++---++---+

Given the initial configuration of the cubes in the box, find out how many cubes are in each of the n columns after Bob switches the gravity.
Examples (input -> output:
* 'R', [3, 2, 1, 2]      ->  [1, 2, 2, 3]

Задача:
In this Kata you are expected to find the coefficients of quadratic equation of the given two roots (x1 and x2).
Equation will be the form of ax^2 + bx + c = 0
Return type is a Vector (tuple in Rust, Array in Ruby) containing coefficients of the equations in the order (a, b, c).
Since there are infinitely many solutions to this problem, we fix a = 1.
Remember, the roots can be written like (x-x1) * (x-x2) = 0
Example
quadratic(1,2) = (1, -3, 2)

This means (x-1) * (x-2) = 0; when we do the multiplication this becomes x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0
Example 2
quadratic(0,1) = (1, -1, 0)

This means (x-0) * (x-1) = 0; when we do the multiplication this becomes x^2 - x + 0 = 0
Notes

Inputs will be integers.
When x1 == x2, this means the root has the multiplicity of two

Задача:
Our football team has finished the championship.
Our team's match results are recorded in a collection of strings. Each match is represented by a string in the format "x:y", where x is our team's score and y is our opponents score.
For example:
["3:1", "2:2", "0:1", ...]
Points are awarded for each match as follows:

if x > y: 3 points (win)
if x < y: 0 points (loss)
if x = y: 1 point  (tie)

We need to write a function that takes this collection and returns the number of points our team (x) got in the championship by the rules given above.
Notes:

our team always plays 10 matches in the championship
0 <= x <= 4
0 <= y <= 4

Task:
A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you. The brick's length and width are equal, forming a square; its height may be different. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decided to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that will accept these parameters:

radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);

And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.

Note:
All inputs are integers. Assume no irregularities to the cuboid brick.
You may assume the bottle is shaped like a cylinder. The brick cannot fit inside the rim. The ice brick placed into the bottle is the largest possible cuboid that could actually fit inside the inner volume. 
Example 1:
radius = 1
bottle_length = 10
rim_length = 2

volume = 16

Example 2:
radius = 5
bottle_length = 30
rim_length = 7

The aspect ratio of an image describes the proportional relationship between its width and its height. Most video shown on the internet uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, which means that for every pixel in the Y, there are roughly 1.77 pixels in the X (where 1.77 ~= 16/9). As an example, 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 16:9 would have an X resolution of 1920, however 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 4:3 would have an X resolution of 1440.
Write a function that accepts arbitrary X and Y resolutions and converts them into resolutions with a 16:9 aspect ratio that maintain equal height. Round your answers up to the nearest integer.
This kata is part of a series with Aspect Ratio Cropping - Part 2 .

Most video shown on the internet uses a 16:9 aspect ratio, which means that for every pixel in the Y, there are roughly 1.77 pixels in the X (where 1.77 ~= 16/9). As an example, 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 16:9 would have an X resolution of 1920, however 1080p video with an aspect ratio of 4:3 would have an X resolution of 1440.
Write a function that accepts arbitrary X and Y resolutions and converts them into resolutions with a 16:9 aspect ratio that maintain equal height. Round your answers up to the nearest integer.
This kata is part of a series with Aspect Ratio Cropping - Part 2 .
Example
374 × 280 pixel image with a 4:3 aspect ratio.

500 × 280 pixel image with a 16:9 aspect ratio.

Задача:
Given an unsorted array of 3 positive integers [ n1, n2, n3 ], determine if it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using those 3 integers.
A Pythagorean Triple consists of arranging 3 integers, such that:
a2 + b2 = c2
Examples
[5, 3, 4] : it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers:
 32 + 42 = 52
[3, 4, 5] : it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers:
 32 + 42 = 52
[13, 12, 5] : it is possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers:
 52 + 122 = 132
[100, 3, 999] : it is NOT possible to form a Pythagorean Triple using these 3 integers - no matter how you arrange them, you will never find a way to satisfy the equation a2 + b2 = c2
Return Values

For Python: return True or False
For JavaScript: return true or false
Other languages: return 1 or 0 or refer to Sample Tests.

The Story:
Bob is working as a bus driver. However, he has become extremely popular amongst the city's residents. With so many passengers wanting to get aboard his bus, he sometimes has to face the problem of not enough space left on the bus! He wants you to write a simple program telling him if he will be able to fit all the passengers.
Task Overview:
You have to write a function that accepts three parameters: 

cap is the amount of people the bus can hold excluding the driver.
on is the number of people on the bus excluding the driver.
wait is the number of people waiting to get on to the bus excluding the driver.

If there is enough space, return 0, and if there isn't, return the number of passengers he can't take.
Usage Examples:
cap = 10, on = 5, wait = 5 --> 0 # He can fit all 5 passengers
cap = 100, on = 60, wait = 50 --> 10 # He can't fit 10 of the 50 waiting

Backstory

As a treat, I'll let you read part of the script from a classic 'I'm Alan Partridge episode:
Lynn: Alan, there’s that teacher chap.
Alan: Michael, if he hits me, will you hit him first?
Michael: No, he’s a customer. I cannot hit customers. I’ve been told. I’ll go and get some stock.
Alan: Yeah, chicken stock.
Phil: Hello Alan.
Alan: Lynn, hand me an apple pie. And remove yourself from the theatre of conflict.
Lynn: What do you mean?
Alan: Go and stand by the yakults. The temperature inside this apple turnover is 1,000 degrees. If I squeeze it, a jet of molten Bramley apple is going to squirt out. Could go your way, could go mine. Either way, one of us is going down.

Alan is known for referring to the temperature of the apple turnover as Hotter than the sun!. According to  space.com the temperature of the sun's corona is 2,000,000 degrees Celsius, but we will ignore the science for now. 
Task
Your job is simple, if x squared is more than 1000, return It's hotter than the sun!!, else, return Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.
Note: Input will either be a positive integer (or a string for untyped languages).

Задача:
The purpose of this kata is to work out just how many bottles of duty free whiskey you would have to buy such that the savings over the normal high street price would effectively cover the cost of your holiday.
You will be given the high street price (normPrice, in £ (Pounds)), the duty free discount (discount, in percent) and the cost of the holiday (in £).
For example, if a bottle costs £10 normally and the duty free discount is 10%, you would save £1 per bottle. If your holiday will cost £500, you would have to purchase 500 bottles to save £500, so the answer you return should be 500.
Another example: if a bottle costs £12 normally and the duty free discount is 50%, you would save £6 per bottle. If your holiday will cost £1000, you would have to purchase 166.66 bottles to save £1000, so your answer should be 166 bottles.
All inputs will be integers. Please return an integer. Round down.

Purchases of 2 or more litres get a discount of 5 cents per litre, purchases of 4 or more litres get a discount of 10 cents per litre, and so on every two litres, up to a maximum discount of 25 cents per litre. But total discount per litre cannot be more than 25 cents. Return the total cost rounded to 2 decimal places. Also you can guess that there will not be negative or non-numeric inputs.
Good Luck!
Note
1 Dollar = 100 Cents

Your start-up's BA has told marketing that your website has a large audience in Scandinavia and surrounding countries. Marketing thinks it would be great to welcome visitors to the site in their own language. Luckily you already use an API that detects the user's location, so this is an easy win. 
The Task

Think of a way to store the languages as a database. The languages are listed below so you can copy and paste!
Write a 'welcome' function that takes a parameter 'language', with a type String, and returns a greeting - if you have it in your database. It should default to English if the language is not in the database, or in the event of an invalid input.

Ahoy Matey!
Welcome to the seven seas.
You are the captain of a pirate ship.
You are in battle against the royal navy.
You have cannons at the ready.... or are they?
Your task is to check if the gunners are loaded and ready, if they are: Fire!
If they aren't ready: Shiver me timbers!
Your gunners for each test case are 2, 3 or 4.
When you check if they are ready their answers are in a dictionary and will either be: aye or nay
Firing with less than all gunners ready is non-optimum (this is not fire at will, this is fire by the captain's orders or walk the plank, dirty sea-dog!)
If all answers are 'aye' then Fire!
if one or more are 'nay' then Shiver me timbers!
Also, check out the new Pirates!! Kata:

Firing with less than all gunners ready is non-optimum (this is not fire at will, this is fire by the captain's orders or walk the plank, dirty sea-dog!)
If all answers are 'aye' then Fire!
if one or more are 'nay' then Shiver me timbers!

Задача:
Suzuki is a monk who climbs a large staircase to the monastery as part of a ritual. Some days he climbs more stairs than others depending on the number of students he must train in the morning. He is curious how many stairs might be climbed over the next 20 years and has spent a year marking down his daily progress. 
The sum of all the stairs logged in a year will be used for estimating the number he might climb in 20. 
20_year_estimate = one_year_total * 20
You will receive the following data structure representing the stairs Suzuki logged in a year. You will have all data for the entire year so regardless of how it is logged the problem should be simple to solve.
stairs = [sunday,monday,tuesday,wednesday,thursday,friday,saturday]

Задача:
Let's build a matchmaking system that helps discover jobs for developers based on a number of factors.
One of the simplest, yet most important factors is compensation. As developers we know how much money we need to support our lifestyle, so we generally have a rough idea of the minimum salary we would be satisfied with. 
Let's give this a try. We'll create a function match (job_matching in Python) which takes a candidate and a job, which will return a Boolean indicating whether the job is a valid match for the candidate. 
A candidate will have a minimum salary, so it will look like this:
let candidate = {
  minSalary: 120000
}

candidate = {
  'min_salary': 120000
}

candidate = {
  'min_salary': 120000
}

Candidate candidate = 
  new Candidate(MinSalary: 120000);

A job will have a maximum salary, so it will look like this: 
let job = {
  maxSalary: 140000
}

job = { 
  'max_salary': 140000
}

job = {
  'max_salary': 140000
}

Job job = 
  new Job(MaxSalary: 140000);

If either the candidate's minimum salary or the job's maximum salary is not present, throw an error. 
For a valid match, the candidate's minimum salary must be less than or equal to the job's maximum salary. However, let's also include 10% wiggle room (deducted from the candidate's minimum salary) in case the candidate is a rockstar who enjoys programming on Codewars in their spare time. The company offering the job may be able to work something out.

(This Kata is originally designed for C# language and it shows that adding a new item to the input list is not going to work, even though the parameter is passed by value, but the value is poining to the reference of list and any change on parameter will be seen by caller)

Задача:
Create a function close_compare that accepts 3 parameters: a, b, and an optional margin. The function should return whether a is lower than, close to, or higher than b. 
Please note the following:

When a is close to b, return 0.
For this challenge, a is considered "close to" b if margin is greater than or equal to the absolute distance between a and b.



Otherwise...

When a is less than b, return -1.

When a is greater than b, return 1.


If margin is not given, treat it as if it were zero.
Assume: margin >= 0
Tip: Some languages have a way to make parameters optional.

Example 1
If a = 3, b = 5, and margin = 3, then close_compare(a, b, margin) should return 0.
This is because a and b are no more than 3 numbers apart.
Example 2
If a = 3, b = 5, and margin = 0, then close_compare(a, b, margin) should return -1. 
This is because the distance between a and b is greater than 0, and a is less than b.

Задача:
The company you work for has just been awarded a contract to build a payment gateway. In order to help move things along, you have volunteered to create a function that will take a float and return the amount formatting in dollars and cents.
39.99 becomes $39.99
The rest of your team will make sure that the argument is sanitized before being passed to your function although you will need to account for adding trailing zeros if they are missing (though you won't have to worry about a dangling period).
Examples:
3 needs to become $3.00

3.1 needs to become $3.10

Good luck! Your team knows they can count on you!

The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

Create a method partition that accepts a list and a method/block. It should return two arrays: the first, with all the elements for which the given block returned true, and the second for the remaining elements.
Here's a simple Ruby example:
animals = ["cat", "dog", "duck", "cow", "donkey"]
partition(animals){|animal| animal.size == 3}
    #=> [["cat", "dog", "cow"], ["duck", "donkey"]]

The equivalent in Python would be:
animals = ['cat', 'dog', 'duck', 'cow', 'donkey']
partition(animals, lambda x: len(x) == 3)
    # (['cat', 'dog', 'cow'], ['duck', 'donkey'])

Task:
Write a function that accepts two integers and returns the remainder of dividing the larger value by the smaller value.
Division by zero should return NaN.
Examples:
n = 17
m = 5
result = 2 (remainder of `17 / 5`)

n = 13
m = 72
result = 7 (remainder of `72 / 13`)

n = 0
m = -1
result = 0 (remainder of `0 / -1`)

n = 0
m = 1
