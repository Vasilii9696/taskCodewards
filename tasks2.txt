Задача:
In this kata, you are given the sum of the number of vertices, edges, and faces of an
N-sided prism, which is equal to s. Your task is to 
determine and return a tuple containing four values: the number of vertices, edges, 
faces, and the number of sides of the base of the prism.
A prism is a polyhedron with two parallel, congruent bases and rectangular lateral 
faces connecting the corresponding sides of the bases.

 triangular prism example:

For an N-sided prism:
Vertices (V): The total number of vertices.
Edges (E): The total number of edges.
Faces (F): The total number of faces.
Base sides (B): The number of sides of the base of the prism.
Given the sum s = V + E + F return the tuple (V ,E ,F ,B).
Constraints:
1. The number of sides of the base B is an integer greater than or equal to 3.

2. The sum s is an integer in the range 4 ≤ 𝑠 ≤ 1000

Задача:
Inputs:
A n × n grid with 1 ≤ n ≤ 9, and 2 integers row,col with 1 ≤ row,col ≤ n, indicating the starting position of the treasure hunt. 
Clues:
Every cell of the grid contains a number between 11 and n2. These values provide the coordinates of the next cell to search. The treasure is found in a cell whose value matches its location. (The clue says "stay where you are"!) There will always be treasure reachable from the starting position.
Output: 
The value in the treasure cell reached by following the clues from the starting position.
Example:
Consider the grid below, with starting position row=3,col=4.
 
34 21 32 44 25 
21 41 43 14 31 
31 45 52 42 23 
33 15 51 44 35 
21 52 33 13 44 

Indexes start from 1, so the value in cell 3,4 is 42. Thus the next clue is found in cell 4,2. The value there is 15. Seeking in cell 1,5 uncovers the clue 25, and cell 2,5 contains 31. Since the value in cell 3,1 is 31, that is the location of the treasure.

Task
Given any positive integer x ≤ 4000, find the smallest positive integer m such that mx consists of all 9's. Return -1 if no such m exists.
Examples:
11 -> 9, because 11 * 9 == 99.
12 -> -1, because 12 is even, so no multiple of it can contain only nines.
13 -> 76923, because 13 * 76923 == 999999, and no smaller positive integer, when multiplied by 13, generates an integer containing only nines.
NOTE: Although x ≤ 4000, m can be very very LARGE. Where necessary, the way of handling big integers appropriate to the language should be used.

Задача:
Inspired by the emojify custom Python module.
You are given a string made up of chains of emotes separated by 1 space each, with chains having 2 spaces in-between each.
Each emote represents a digit:
:)  | 0
:D  | 1
>(  | 2
>:C | 3
:/  | 4
:|  | 5
:O  | 6
;)  | 7
^.^ | 8
:(  | 9

Each emote chain represents the digits of the ASCII/Unicode code for a character, e.g. :( ;) is 97, which is the ASCII code for 'a'.
Given a such string of emotes, find the string it represents. Example:
':D :) :/  :D :) :|' is 2 chains: ':D :) :/' and ':D :) :|'.
These represent ASCII codes 104 and 105 respectively, translating to 'hi'.
Input will always be valid. Chains may start with leading zeroes; these are valid and do not change the chain's value.

Задача:
You order a shirt for your friend that has a word written in sign language on it, you would like to fool your friend into thinking it says something other than what it actually says.
Your friend is smart, but he can't know what he doesn't already know, he only knows a certain amount of letters in sign language. Given the word on the shirt, the word you are attempting to make your friend believe is on the shirt, and the letters in sign language your friends knows, figure out if he can tell that you are fooling him. Return true if your friend can figure out you are fooling him, otherwise return false.
It is guaranteed that both words will be the same length and will be in lowercase letters (a-z)
Example 1:
Word on shirt: snack
Word you said: snake
Letters your friend knows: [c]

return true
Your friend knows the 4th letter is a c rather than a k.

If the word on the shirt and the word you told your friend is the same then you aren't fooling your friend, so you should return false
Example 2:
Word on shirt: snack
Word you said: snack
Letters your friend knows: [s, n, a, c, k]

return false 
Since you are not fooling your friend

Example 3:
Word on shirt: snake
Word you said: snack
Letters your friend knows: [c]

return true 
Your friend knows that the 4th letter is not a c

Example 4:
Word on shirt: smile
Word you said: smirk
Letters your friend knows: [s, m, i]

return false
Your friend doesn't know what the letters l and e from smi(le) look like in sign language.
So he cannot say that those letters are not r or k from smi(rk) because he wouldn't know
So your friend cannot figure out if you are fooling him.

Word you said: snake
Letters your friend knows: [c]

return true
Your friend knows the 4th letter is a c rather than a k.

If the word on the shirt and the word you told your friend is the same then you aren't fooling your friend, so you should return false
Example 2:
Word on shirt: snack
Word you said: snack
Letters your friend knows: [s, n, a, c, k]

return false 
Since you are not fooling your friend

Example 3:
Word on shirt: snake
Word you said: snack
Letters your friend knows: [c]

return true 
Your friend knows that the 4th letter is not a c

Example 4:
Word on shirt: smile
Word you said: smirk
Letters your friend knows: [s, m, i]

return false
Your friend doesn't know what the letters l and e from smi(le) look like in sign language.
So he cannot say that those letters are not r or k from smi(rk) because he wouldn't know
So your friend cannot figure out if you are fooling him.

Задача:
You order a shirt for your friend that has a word written in sign language on it, you would like to fool your friend into thinking it says something other than what it actually says.
Your friend is smart, but he can't know what he doesn't already know, he only knows a certain amount of letters in sign language. Given the word on the shirt, the word you are attempting to make your friend believe is on the shirt, and the letters in sign language your friends knows, figure out if he can tell that you are fooling him. Return true if your friend can figure out you are fooling him, otherwise return false.
It is guaranteed that both words will be the same length and will be in lowercase letters (a-z)
Example 1:
Word on shirt: snack
Word you said: snake
Letters your friend knows: [c]

return true
Your friend knows the 4th letter is a c rather than a k.

If the word on the shirt and the word you told your friend is the same then you aren't fooling your friend, so you should return false

Задача:
ISBN
An ISBN (International Standard Book Number) is a ten digit code which uniquely identifies a book. The first nine digits represent the book and the last digit is used to make sure the ISBN is correct. To verify an ISBN you calculate 10 times the first digit, plus 9 times the second digit, plus 8 times the third... all the way until you add 1 times the last digit. If the final number leaves no remainder when divided by 11 the code is a valid ISBN.
For example 0201103311 is a valid ISBN, since 10*0 + 9*2 + 8*0 + 7*1 + 6*1 + 5*0 + 4*3 + 3*3 + 2*1 + 1*1 = 55.
Each of the first nine digits can take a value between 0 and 9. Sometimes it is necessary to make the last digit equal to ten; this is done by writing the last digit as X. For example, 156881111X.
Write a program that reads in an ISBN code (will always be valid) with a single missing digit, marked with a ?, and outputs the correct value for the missing digit. 
Example:
15688?111X => "1"
020161586? => "X"

Input/Output

[input] string representing the 10-digit ISBN code 15688?111X
[output] string representing the missing digit '1'

Задача:
Two players draw a pair of numbered cards so that both players can form a 2 digit number. A winner can be decided if one player's number is larger than the other.
However, there is a rule where a player can swap any one of their cards with any one of the other player's cards in a gamble to get a higher number! Note that it is illegal to swap the order of your own cards. That means if you draw a 1 then a 9, you cannot swap them to get 91.

Paul's strategy is to always swap his lowest number with the opponent's ten's digit. Return whether this results in Paul winning the round.

n1 is Paul's number
n2 is his opponent's number

Worked Example
(41, 79) ➞ true
# Paul's lowest number is 1
# The opponent's ten's digit is 7
# After the swap: 47 > 19
# Paul wins the round

Examples
(41, 98) ➞ true

(12, 28) ➞ true

(67, 53) ➞ false

(77, 54) ➞ false

Notes

If both of Paul's digits are the same, swap the ten's digit with the opponent's (paul likes to live riskily).
The cards don't include the number 0.
11 <= All numbers <= 99 (excluding numbers containing 0)

Задача:
Matryoshka dolls are traditionally wooden dolls that can be nested by fitting smaller dolls into larger ones. Similarly, we can nest lists by placing smaller lists into larger ones, following specific rules.
Rules for Nesting:

List A can be nested inside List B if:
The minimum value in List A is greater than the minimum value in List B.
The maximum value in List A is smaller than the maximum value in List B.



Example 1:

List A: [2, 3, 9, 5]
List B: [10, 2, 1]
Explanation:
min(A) = 2 > 1 = min(B)
max(A) = 9 < 10 = max(B)


Result: A can be nested inside B.

Example 2:

List A: [4, 5]
List B: [6, 3]
Explanation:
min(A) = 4 > 3 = min(B)
max(A) = 5 < 6 = max(B)


Result: A can be nested inside B.

Example 3:

List A: [7, 1]
List B: [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]
Explanation:
Both lists share the same maximum value (7).


Result: A cannot be nested properly inside B.

Example 4:

List A: [1, 5]
List B: [2, 6]
Explanation:
Elements in the lists overlap, making nesting impossible.


Result: A cannot be nested inside B.

Example 5:

List A: [1,2,3,4]
List B: [0,3,5]
List C: [2,2,3]]
Explanation:
List C and List A meet the criteria because 2 > 1 and 3 < 4.
List A and List B also meet the criteria because 1 > 0 and 4 < 5.


Result: List B can be nested inside List A, and List A can be nested inside List C.

Additional Notes:

Sublists can be nested in either ascending (smallest to largest) or descending (largest to smallest) order.
Strict nesting is required; no two lists can share the same maximum or minimum values.

List B: [2, 6]
Explanation:
Elements in the lists overlap, making nesting impossible.


Result: A cannot be nested inside B.

Example 5:

List A: [1,2,3,4]
List B: [0,3,5]
List C: [2,2,3]]
Explanation:
List C and List A meet the criteria because 2 > 1 and 3 < 4.
List A and List B also meet the criteria because 1 > 0 and 4 < 5.


Result: List B can be nested inside List A, and List A can be nested inside List C.

Additional Notes:

Sublists can be nested in either ascending (smallest to largest) or descending (largest to smallest) order.
Strict nesting is required; no two lists can share the same maximum or minimum values.

Задача:
Matryoshka dolls are traditionally wooden dolls that can be nested by fitting smaller dolls into larger ones. Similarly, we can nest lists by placing smaller lists into larger ones, following specific rules.
Rules for Nesting:

List A can be nested inside List B if:
The minimum value in List A is greater than the minimum value in List B.
The maximum value in List A is smaller than the maximum value in List B.



Example 1:

List A: [2, 3, 9, 5]
List B: [10, 2, 1]
Explanation:
min(A) = 2 > 1 = min(B)
max(A) = 9 < 10 = max(B)


Result: A can be nested inside B.

Example 2:

List A: [4, 5]
List B: [6, 3]
Explanation:
min(A) = 4 > 3 = min(B)
max(A) = 5 < 6 = max(B)


Result: A can be nested inside B.

Example 3:

List A: [7, 1]
List B: [7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]
Explanation:
Both lists share the same maximum value (7).

Задача:
Traditional safes use a three-wheel locking mechanism, with the safe combination entered using a dial on the door of the safe. The dial is marked with clockwise increments between 0 and 99. The three-number combination is entered by first dialling to the right (clockwise), then to the left (anti-clockwise), and then to the right (clockwise) again. Combination numbers are read from the top of the dial:

Given the starting (top) position of the dial and the increments used for each turn of the dial, return a tuple containing the combination of the safe.
Step-By-Step Example
(0, (3, 10, 5)) ➞ (97, 7, 2)

Starting dial position of 0 (same as the diagram above).

First turn (rightward) of 3 increments:
0 -> 99, 98, 97
First number of combination = 97

Second turn (leftward) of 10 increments:
97 -> 98, 99, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
Second number of combination = 7

Third turn (rightward) of 5 increments:
7 -> 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
Third number of combination = 2

The final combination is (97, 7, 2)

Other Examples
(96, (54, 48, 77)) ➞ (42, 90, 13)

Задача:
Spark plugs, distributor wires, and firing order.
Your car's engine operates by containing tiny explosions caused by gas being ignited by spark plugs, which compresses a pistion, causing the engine to turn. Spark plugs are sparked by receiving electrical signal through a wire connected to a distributing system.  If you're curious, here's an explanation of the whole process. If you watch the video, you can ignore the formulas, as this kata is about firing order, and not combustion physics. 

  In short, to make sure that this process is balanced, and engine rotation is maintained constantly, each cylinder of an engine is fired in an order determined by the manufacturer. There are a few cases where optimal order is very well documented. For example, with an inline 4-cylinder engine, 'I4' the optimal firing order is 1-3-4-2. Because of this, most (but not all...) manufacturers use this order. With different engine layouts, and sizes, sometimes manufacturers will change the order slightly to give more power but less balance, or less power and more engine longevity.
Please note: This is not car repair advice. If you think your car has a misfire, please look up the exact engine your car uses before attempting any of these sequences. AKA have fun, trust the mechanic instead of random internet man.
Your task is relatively simple
Write a function helps us diagnose where a misfire is located. A misfire is typically caused by a faulty wire, or old spark plug. This causes the engine to fire on every cylinder except the one that is bad. For example, with our typical inline 4 engine, if cylinder #3 has a misfire, the engine would receive full rotation in #1, #4, and #2, but #3 would give no rotation at all, causing major issues. For our case, we are assuming that an engine needs at least 1 cylinder functioning for us to diagnose the bad cylinders.
Your function should take one argument, which is a string with the following syntax:
                MAKE | ENGINE SIZE  |  CURRENT ORDER
                -----+--------------+----------------
                Ford |      V8      | 1-X-4-2-X-3-X-8

An "X" indicates a cylinder that has not fired. Your goal is to return a string with the correct cylinder number, in the correct sequence for that make and engine size. In the example above, the correct return value is: "5-6-7". If there are no misfires, return an empty string. You have been provided with a python nested dictionary named CARS that you can call as you please. All elements of CARS are strings. The maker is the first key, the engine size is the second key. Below examples that will be included in the test cases.
INPUT: 'Ford V8 1-X-4-2-X-3-X-8' |  OUTPUT: '5-6-7'

Задача:
Spark plugs, distributor wires, and firing order.
Your car's engine operates by containing tiny explosions caused by gas being ignited by spark plugs, which compresses a pistion, causing the engine to turn. Spark plugs are sparked by receiving electrical signal through a wire connected to a distributing system.  If you're curious, here's an explanation of the whole process. If you watch the video, you can ignore the formulas, as this kata is about firing order, and not combustion physics. 

  In short, to make sure that this process is balanced, and engine rotation is maintained constantly, each cylinder of an engine is fired in an order determined by the manufacturer. There are a few cases where optimal order is very well documented. For example, with an inline 4-cylinder engine, 'I4' the optimal firing order is 1-3-4-2. Because of this, most (but not all...) manufacturers use this order. With different engine layouts, and sizes, sometimes manufacturers will change the order slightly to give more power but less balance, or less power and more engine longevity.
Please note: This is not car repair advice. If you think your car has a misfire, please look up the exact engine your car uses before attempting any of these sequences. AKA have fun, trust the mechanic instead of random internet man.
Your task is relatively simple
Write a function helps us diagnose where a misfire is located. A misfire is typically caused by a faulty wire, or old spark plug. This causes the engine to fire on every cylinder except the one that is bad. For example, with our typical inline 4 engine, if cylinder #3 has a misfire, the engine would receive full rotation in #1, #4, and #2, but #3 would give no rotation at all, causing major issues. For our case, we are assuming that an engine needs at least 1 cylinder functioning for us to diagnose the bad cylinders.
Your function should take one argument, which is a string with the following syntax:
                MAKE | ENGINE SIZE  |  CURRENT ORDER
                -----+--------------+----------------
                Ford |      V8      | 1-X-4-2-X-3-X-8

An "X" indicates a cylinder that has not fired. Your goal is to return a string with the correct cylinder number, in the correct sequence for that make and engine size. In the example above, the correct return value is: "5-6-7". If there are no misfires, return an empty string. You have been provided with a python nested dictionary named CARS that you can call as you please. All elements of CARS are strings. The maker is the first key, the engine size is the second key. Below examples that will be included in the test cases.

Note

The function should return an integer.
The base b will be greater or equal to 1.
Edge case: Base-1 is also used in this kata to represent the unary numeral system. Think of it as a system of tally marks. For example: 
3 (decimal) -> ||| (unary)
5 (decimal) -> ||||| (unary)

Задача:
Task:
In this Golfing Kata, you are going to receive 2 non-negative numbers a and b, b is equal to or greater than a.
Then do the following procedure:

Add a to b, then divide it by 2 with integer division.

Repeat the procedure until b is equal to a.

Return how many times it took to make b equal to a.

Now golf your code, the length limit is 35, in one line.


(The length of reference solution is 31)

Examples:
a = 3 and b = 9

b = (3 + 9) // 2 = 6  ---  1 time

b = (3 + 6) // 2 = 4  ---  2 times

b = (3 + 4) // 2 = 3  ---  3 times

So the result for a=3 and b=9 is `3`.

Задача:
This is a rather simple but interesting kata. Try to solve it using logic. The shortest solution can be fit into one line.
Task
The point is that a natural number N (1 <= N <= 10^9) is given. You need to write a function which finds the number of natural numbers not exceeding N and not divided by any of the numbers [2, 3, 5].

Example
Let's take the number 5 as an example:

1 - doesn't divide integer by 2, 3, and 5
2 - divides integer by 2
3 - divides integer by 3
4 - divides integer by 2
5 - divides integer by 5

Answer: 1
because only one number doesn't divide integer by any of 2, 3, 5

Note
Again, try to think of a formula that will shorten your solution and help you pass big tests.
Good luck :)

Barbell weight
Kata overview
Olympic weightlifting is a sport in which athletes compete in lifting a barbell from the ground to overhead, with the aim of successfully lifting the heaviest weights.
The purpose of this kata is to compute the weight of an Olympic barbell.
Task
Write a function that computes the barbell weight.
Input
A string representation of a barbell, in the form ---gcBRRRR--------------------RRRRBcg---.
Weights are always between 25 - 274 kg (both included).
Output
The weight of the barbell in kg (integer).
Barbell details
A barbell consists of three parts:

Bar
Discs
Collars

The bar weighs 20 kg and uses character -. The bar is 40 characters long.
Discs are loaded and secured by collars on the sleeve of the bar. The bar is loaded with the heaviest discs first and then the lighter discs loaded in descending order of weight toward the outer edge of the bar. The following discs are used. Discs are loaded from the 10th character from the outer edge of the bar.
WEIGHT  COLOR   CHAR
25 kg   red     R
20 kg   blue    B

Set Reducer
Intro
These arrays are too long! Let's reduce them!
Description
Write a function that takes in an array of integers from 0-9, and returns a new array:

Numbers with no identical numbers preceding or following it returns a 1: 2, 4, 9  => 1, 1, 1
Sequential groups of identical numbers return their count: 6, 6, 6, 6 => 4

Example
[0, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 7] => [1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1]
Your function should then repeat the process on the resulting array, and on the resulting array of that, until it returns a single integer:
[0, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 7] =>  [1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1] => [3, 1, 1, 1] => [1, 3] => [1, 1] => [2]
When your function has reduced the array to a single integer following these rules, it should return that integer.
[2] => 2
Rules and assertions

All test arrays will be 2+ in length
All integers in the test arrays will be positive numbers from 0 - 9
You should return an integer, not an array with 1 element

Задача:
Set Reducer
Intro
These arrays are too long! Let's reduce them!
Description
Write a function that takes in an array of integers from 0-9, and returns a new array:

Numbers with no identical numbers preceding or following it returns a 1: 2, 4, 9  => 1, 1, 1
Sequential groups of identical numbers return their count: 6, 6, 6, 6 => 4

Example
[0, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 7] => [1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1]
Your function should then repeat the process on the resulting array, and on the resulting array of that, until it returns a single integer:
[0, 4, 6, 8, 8, 8, 5, 5, 7] =>  [1, 1, 1, 3, 2, 1] => [3, 1, 1, 1] => [1, 3] => [1, 1] => [2]
When your function has reduced the array to a single integer following these rules, it should return that integer.

Задача:
No French knowledge is needed for this kata!
A note for the people who do know French: this kata will skip the step of turning the verb into it's Nous form, to maintain simplicity. That means verbs like Manger will be Mangais, instead of Mangeais. Oh, and no être ;-)

Details
(You may skip this part)
When speaking/writing French, you use L’imparfait (the imperfect tense) to describe continuous or habitual actions in the past. 
For example, you would use l'imparfait to translate "I was thinking", because thinking is an action that happens over a length of time. You wouldn't use l'imparfait to translate "I won the boss battle", as it's an action that happens once. 
Think of it as the French equivalent of our Past Progressive.
Task
Given a simple French phrase, consisting of a subject and a verb in its infinitive form, you need to turn it into L'imparfait, using the table below. To conjugate a sentence in l'imparfait, drop the last two letters of the verb and replace it with the correct ending based on the subject.
Here are the endings to replace the verb with:



Subject
Verb Ending



Je (I)
-ais


Tu (You)
-ais


Il/Elle/On (He/She/It or We)
-ait


Nous (We)
-ions


Vous (You or Y'all)
-iez


Ils/Elles (They)
-aient


Let's say you want to translate I was walking to French: 

Take the subject + infinitive: Je marcher
Remove the last two letters: Je march
Apply the correct ending: Je marchais

You get Je marchais, which can be checked with our handy dandy google translate.
Examples
Je manger     -->  Je mangais   
Tu dormir     -->  Tu dormais
Elle coder    -->  Elle codait
Il livrer     -->  Il livrait
On parler     -->  On parlait
Nous aller    -->  Nous allions
Vous partir   -->  Vous partiez
Ils jouer     -->  Ils jouaient
Elles gagner  -->  Elles gagnaient

Задача:
You just started working at a local cinema, and your first task is to write a function that returns the showtimes of a specific movie, given its length. In order to make your job easier, you will work with 24-hour format throughout this kata.
Your function receives three parameters, all of them being integers:

open - Hour at which the cinema opens.
close - Hour at which the cinema closes.
length - Length of the movie, in minutes.

It must return an array of times, with each time being in the format (hour, minute). For example, (19, 30) means 19:30, and (2, 0) means 02:00. The last session in the array cannot end after the cinema closes. Also, the times in the array must be sorted from earliest to latest.
There's also a 15-minute window between a session's end and the beginning of the following one, in order to give enough time for users to take a seat.
For example, for a cinema opening at 13:00 and closing at 23:00 showing a 60-minute movie, your function must return the following array:
>>> movie_times(13, 23, 60)
[(13, 0), (14, 15), (15, 30), (16, 45), (18, 0), (19, 15), (20, 30), (21, 45)]

Note that the cinema might close at times such as 02:00 or 03:00, meaning examples like this must also work:
>>> movie_times(16, 3, 75)
[(16, 0), (17, 30), (19, 0), (20, 30), (22, 0), (23, 30), (1, 0)]

IMPORTANT: For languages other than Python, just return an array of arrays. See sample test cases for more info on how to return the list of times.
NOTE: This kata isn't meant to be too challenging, so opening times for all tests will be 12:00 or later, and closing times will always be 6:00 or earlier.
NOTE 2: Midnight will be represented as (0, 0) or 0:00 in this kata, instead of 24:00.
Good luck!

You need to find, if given a multi-line string road, whether the speeding car will crash or not.
A road will always contain the following:

The speeding car, O='`o, who's driver is too scared to turn.
The other cars, signified by X's. They will always be heading in the same direction as the car.

The function returns true/ True if there are X's ahead of the speeding car in the same lane, but returns false/False if the speeding car has already passed all of the car's in the lane, or if its lane is empty.
Examples:
These three will all return true (crash):

O='`o X                          


 X                  O='`o                              X

Задача:
This is Part 1 of this series of two katas — Part 2 is here.
If you like playing cards, have also a look at Hide a message in a deck of playing cards and Card-Chameleon, a Cipher with Playing cards.


In this series of two katas, we will draw playing cards from a deck using a particular procedure: after drawing one card, we place the next one at the bottom of the deck.
In details, the procedure is:

We draw the top card of the deck.
We take the next card, and put it at the bottom of the deck.
We repeat steps 1 and 2 until there aren't any card left in the deck.

Let's take a small deck containing four cards — named A, B, C, D — as an example:

The deck order is A-B-C-D at the beginning, the card A is at the top and D at the bottom.
A is drawn. The deck is now B-C-D.
B is placed at the bottom of the deck. The deck is now C-D-B.
C is drawn. The deck is now D-B.
D is placed at the bottom of the deck. The deck is now B-D.
B is drawn. The deck is now D.
D is drawn.

The order of the cards drawn is A-C-B-D.
Your task
Write a function accepting a deck of cards as argument, and returning the cards drawn following the procedure.
const draw = (deck) => {

draw = (deck) ->

export const draw = (deck: string[]): string[] => {

public static List<String> draw(List<String> deck) {

def draw(deck: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = ???

Each card is represented with a two-character string: the rank of the card and its suit.
AC 2C 3C 4C 5C 6C 7C 8C 9C TC JC QC KC for the Clubs
AD 2D 3D 4D 5D 6D 7D 8D 9D TD JD QD KD for the Diamonds
AH 2H 3H 4H 5H 6H 7H 8H 9H TH JH QH KH for the Hearts
AS 2S 3S 4S 5S 6S 7S 8S 9S TS JS QS KS for the Spades
A preloaded function allows to easily print a deck to the console:
printDeck(deck, unicode);

printDeck deck, unicode

import { printDeck } from "./preloaded";

printDeck(deck, unicode);

DeckPrinter.printDeck(deck, unicode);

import Preloaded.printDeck

printDeck(deck, unicode)

The first argument is the deck to print, the second one is a boolean value allowing the selection of the character set: regular or Unicode (for which a font containing the playing cards characters needs to be installed on your system).
Example
const deck = ["KC", "KH", "QC", "KS", "KD", "QH", "QD", "QS"];

draw(deck);

deck = ["KC", "KH", "QC", "KS", "KD", "QH", "QD", "QS"]

draw deck

const deck = ["KC", "KH", "QC", "KS", "KD", "QH", "QD", "QS"];

draw(deck);

List<String> deck = Arrays.asList(new String[] {"KC", "KH", "QC", "KS", "KD", "QH", "QD", "QS"});

CardDraw.draw(deck);

val deck = Seq("KC", "KH", "QC", "KS", "KD", "QH", "QD", "QS")

draw(deck)

should return:
["KC", "QC", "KD", "QD", "KH", "QH", "KS", "QS"];

["KC", "QC", "KD", "QD", "KH", "QH", "KS", "QS"]

["KC", "QC", "KD", "QD", "KH", "QH", "KS", "QS"];

["KC", "QC", "KD", "QD", "KH", "QH", "KS", "QS"];

Seq("KC", "QC", "KD", "QD", "KH", "QH", "KS", "QS")

Have fun!
I hope you will enjoy this kata! Feedbacks and translations are very welcome.
After this one, jump to Part 2, where we will be ordering the deck to be drawn to have a chosen result!

This is Part 1 of this series of two katas — Part 2 is here.
If you like playing cards, have also a look at Hide a message in a deck of playing cards and Card-Chameleon, a Cipher with Playing cards.


In this series of two katas, we will draw playing cards from a deck using a particular procedure: after drawing one card, we place the next one at the bottom of the deck.
In details, the procedure is:

We draw the top card of the deck.
We take the next card, and put it at the bottom of the deck.
We repeat steps 1 and 2 until there aren't any card left in the deck.

Let's take a small deck containing four cards — named A, B, C, D — as an example:

The deck order is A-B-C-D at the beginning, the card A is at the top and D at the bottom.
A is drawn. The deck is now B-C-D.
B is placed at the bottom of the deck. The deck is now C-D-B.
C is drawn. The deck is now D-B.
D is placed at the bottom of the deck. The deck is now B-D.
B is drawn. The deck is now D.
D is drawn.

The order of the cards drawn is A-C-B-D.
Your task
Write a function accepting a deck of cards as argument, and returning the cards drawn following the procedure.
const draw = (deck) => {

draw = (deck) ->

export const draw = (deck: string[]): string[] => {

public static List<String> draw(List<String> deck) {

def draw(deck: Seq[String]): Seq[String] = ???

Each card is represented with a two-character string: the rank of the card and its suit.

Задача:
Description
   Steve, from minecraft, is jumping down from blocks to blocks and can get damages at each jump. Damage depends on distance between blocks and block type he jumped on. The goal is to know if he survives his descent or not.
You are given a list of N blocks as strings, in the format 'BLOCK_HEIGHT BLOCK_TYPE'. Steve jumps from one block to the next, and get damages calculated with the following formula:
DMG = max(0, (DISTANCE - 3.5) * (1 - DMG_REDUCTION))

  The distance is calculated as the difference between the height of the current and the next block. DMG should be rounded down to the nearest integral. 
 DMG_REDUCTION depends on BLOCK_TYPE:
BLOCK_TYPE --> DMG_REDUCTION
'D' --> 0 #Dirt block
'B' --> 0.5 #Bed
'H' --> 0.8 #Hay block
'W' --> 1 #Water block

Task
  Write a function, that returns the outcome for Steve:

If he survives, it returns 'jumped to the end with X remaining HP', where X is the remaining HP at the end of the array.
If he dies before the end of the array, it returns 'died on I', where I is the index of the jump he dies.

Rules

Steve has 20 HP at the start. If HP drops below or equal 0, Steve dies. 
BLOCK_TYPE can be 'D' or 'B' or 'H' or 'W' only.
N cannot be less than 2.
BLOCK_HEIGHT[i] cannot be less than BLOCK_HEIGHT[i+1] and always non-negative integral.
All inputs are valid according to the rules.

Examples (input --> output)
['10 D', '4 D', '0 D'] --> 'jumped to the end with 18 remaining HP'     
    |      |      |
    |      |   The third block with height 0 and type D
    |   The second block with height 4 and type D
 The first block with height 10 and type D
 
 /*All blocks are type D, so DMG_REDUCTION will be 0 for all cases
 DISTANCE on the first jump will be 10 - 4 = 6
 DMG on the first jump will be max(0, (6 - 3.5) * (1 - 0)) = 2.5 -> 2 (rounding down)
 DISTANCE on the second jump will be 4 - 0 = 4
 DMG on the second jump will be max(0, (4 - 3,5) * (1 - 0)) = 0.5 -> 0 (rounding down)
 So HP in the end will be 20 - 2 - 0 = 18*/
 
 
['100 D', '50 H'] --> 'jumped to the end with 11 remaining HP'

['999 D', '0 W'] --> 'jumped to the end with 20 remaining HP'

['999 D', '0 D'] --> 'died on 1'

Task
A coder friend of yours gave you some queries which -he promises- will
return interesting results. But some of the queries contain outdated 
filters which don't work anymore. Hence, you decide to code a function
named is_valid (isValid for js) which takes in a search query of 
type str and validates that every filter within the query is up-to-date. 
If only one filter is invalid, then the entire query is invalid.

Preloaded
FILTERS - A tuple of valid search filters

Note

A search query will contain 0 < n < 100 filters


Your function should return True for valid and False for invalid


Each filter follows the <filter-name>:<value> syntax

Filters are seperated by a space (\s)


You only need to check if the filter-name is valid

For a filter-name to be valid, the FILTERS array must contain this filter-name.

The Twenty-One Card Trick, also known as the 11th card trick or three column trick, is a simple self-working card trick that uses basic mathematics to reveal the user's selected card.The game uses a selection of 21 cards out of a standard deck. These are shuffled and the player selects one at random. The cards are then dealt out face up in three columns of 7 cards each. The player points to the column containing their card. The cards are picked up and the process is repeated three times, at which point the magician reveals the selected card.

Source: Wikipedia
Your task is to implement an algorithm that is able to execute the Twenty-One Card Trick. To simplify things, the cards will be changed to the set of integers between 1 and 21(inclusive). The function will be passed as argument a member of the audience that has selected a certain card and has a method get_input that receives a list of 3 lists as arguments and returns the index of the column containing the selected card. Example:
audience = Audience(13) # The audience member has selected the card 13

> audience.get_input([[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [8,9,10,11,12,13,14], [15,16,17,18,19,20,21]])
1 # Since 13 is at the 2nd column

audience = Audience.new 13

> audience.get_input [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7], [8,9,10,11,12,13,14], [15,16,17,18,19,20,21]]
1 # Since 13 is at the 2nd column

const audience = new Audience(13);

Задача:
Task
Write a function that checks if two non-negative integers make an "interlocking binary pair".
Interlock ?

numbers can be interlocked if their binary representations have no 1's in the same place
comparisons are made by bit position, starting from right to left (see the examples below)
when representations are of different lengths, the unmatched left-most bits are ignored

Examples

a = 9, b = 4
Stacking representations shows how they can interlock.
 9    1001
 4     100

Here, no 1's share any position, so the function returns true.

a = 3, b = 6
These representations do not interlock.
 3      11
 6     110

Finding they both have a 1 in the same position, the function returns false.


Input
Two non-negative integers.
Output
Boolean true or false whether or not these integers are interlockable.

Задача:
Fischer random chess, also known as Chess960, is a variant of chess, invented by Bobby Fischer on June 19, 1996.
The rules are the same as regular chess, but the starting position is randomized according to the randomization rules (see below). Note that prior knowledge of chess is not required to solve this kata, however some basic knowledge like piece distribution, initial setup, ranks vs files etc. is assumed. Here is a quick refresher.
Randomization Rules

The 2nd and 7th rank stay the same as in a normal game, filled with pawns.
All the remaining white pieces must be on the 1st rank, and black pieces on the 8th rank.
The two bishops must start on differently colored squares.
The rooks must be located on either side of the king; in other words, the king must be placed on a square between the two rooks.
The queen and knights can be located on any remaining square in the rank.

Both White and Black share the same starting position, drawn at random, in accordance to these rules.
Side note: in accordance with these rules, there are a total of 960 possible starting positions, hence the name of the variant.
Representation of position
For the purpose of this kata:

Rooks are abbreviated as R
Knights are abbreviated as N
Bishops are abbreviated as B
Queen is abbreviated as Q
King is abbreviated as K

Since black mirrors white's setup, it is enough to list White's position to fully describe the position. Furthermore, only the first rank needs to be defined, as the second rank is filled with pawns regardless of situation.
A starting position is represented by an 8 character long String. Each character in the String denotes a specific piece, in order from left-to-right.
An example starting position would be:
 RNBQKBNR
Your task
Given a string representation, determine whether it represents a valid Chess960 starting position. Note that the input is guaranteed to represent one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops and two knights, in some order. You do not have to validate for missing pieces or extra pieces.

The 2 main sequences in Mathematics are Arithmetic Progression and Geometric Progression. Those are the sequences you will be working with in this kata.
Introduction
A sequence of numbers is called an Arithmetic Progression if the difference between any two consecutive terms is always same. In simple terms, it means that next number in the series is calculated by adding a fixed number to the previous number in the series. This fixed number is called the common difference.
A sequence of numbers is called a Geometric Progression if the ratio of any two consecutive terms is always same. In simple terms, it means that next number in the series is calculated by multiplying a fixed number to the previous number in the series. This fixed number is called the common ratio.
Rules
Given an array of integers that follow either series, you have to determine the series and return accordingly :
"0" if it is an AP
"1" if it is a GP
"-1" if it doesn't follow any of the above sequences
"2" if it is both an AP and GP

For Example,
  series_array = [2, 5, 8, 11, 14]   #should return 0
  series_array = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16]    #should return 1
  series_array = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4, 5]  #should return -1
  series_array = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]     #should return 2
  series_array = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]     #should return 0

The main challenge is identifying the differences between the 2 sequences and to find a way of determining each sequence
If the series has all 0's, then 0 should be returned as it is not accepted as a 
term GP
NOTE : Only APs and GPs are considered in this question. Other series like Harmonic Progression are not considered and assume that the array will have atleast one element

Задача:
In Python, == tests for equality and is tests for identity. Two strings that are equal may also be identical, but this is not guaranteed, but rather an implementation detail. Given a computed expression, ensure that it is identical to the corresponding equal string literal by completing the make_identical function. See test case for clarity. (Note, this is easy if you know the concept.)

Задача:
In a certain kingdom, strange mathematics is taught at school. Its main difference from ordinary mathematics is that the numbers in it are not ordered in ascending order, but lexicographically, as in a dictionary (first by the first digit, then, if the first digit is equal, by the second, and so on). In addition, we do not consider an infinite set of natural numbers, but only the first n numbers. 
So, for example, if n = 11, then the numbers in strange mathematics are ordered as follows:
1, 10, 11, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Help your students to learn this science: write a function that receives two integer numbers: n (total amount of numbers in strange mathematics) and k (number from sequence) and returns the location of a given number k in the order defined in strange mathematics. 
For example, if n = 11 and k = 2, the function should return 4 as the answer.
Input: 1 <= n <= 100 000 , 1 <= k <= n.
Output: position of the number k in sequence of the first n natural numbers in lexicographic order. Numbering starts with 1.
Examples:
strange_math(11, 2) == 4
strange_math(15, 5) == 11
strange_math(15, 15) == 7

strangeMath(11, 2) === 4

Задача:
Given: a sequence of different type of values (number, string, boolean). You should return an object with a separate properties for each of types presented in input. Each property should contain an array of corresponding values.

keep order of values like in input array
if type is not presented in input, no corresponding property are expected

So, for this input:
['a', 1, 2, false, 'b']

['a', 1, 2, False, 'b']

expected output is:
{
  number: [1, 2],
  string: ['a', 'b'],
  boolean: [false]
}

{
  int: [1, 2],
  str: ['a', 'b'],
  bool: [False]

Задача:
You are given an array of 6-faced dice. Each die is represented by its face up.
Calculate the minimum number of rotations needed to make all faces the same.
1 will require one rotation to have 2, 3, 4 and 5 face up, but would require two rotations to make it the face 6, as 6 is the opposite side of 1.
The opposite side of 2 is 5 and 3 is 4.
Examples
dice = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 6} --> 2:
rotate 6 twice to get 1

dice = {1, 2, 3} --> 2:
2 rotations are needed to make all faces either 1, 2, or 3

dice = {3, 3, 3} --> 0:
all faces are already identical

dice = {1, 6, 2, 3} --> 3:
rotate 1, 6 and 3 once to make them all 2

Задача:
Task
You've just moved into a perfectly straight street with exactly n identical houses on either side of the road. Naturally, you would like to find out the house number of the people on the other side of the street. The street looks something like this:

Street
1|   |6
3|   |4
5|   |2
  you

Evens increase on the right; odds decrease on the left. House numbers start at 1 and increase without gaps.
When n = 3, 1 is opposite 6, 3 opposite 4, and 5 opposite 2. 

Example (address, n --> output)
Given your house number address and length of street n, give the house number on the opposite side of the street.
1, 3 --> 6
3, 3 --> 4
2, 3 --> 5
3, 5 --> 8

Note about errors
If you are timing out, running out of memory, or get any kind of "error", read on.
Both n and address could get upto 500 billion with over 200 random tests. If you try to store the addresses of 500 billion houses in a list then you will run out of memory and the tests will crash. This is not a kata problem so please don't post an issue. Similarly if the tests don't complete within 12 seconds then you also fail. 
To solve this, you need to think of a way to do the kata without making massive lists or huge for loops. Read the discourse for some inspiration :)

Задача:
You're in the casino, playing Roulette, going for the "1-18" bets only and desperate to beat the house and so you want to test how effective the Martingale strategy is. 
You will be given a starting cash balance and an array of binary digits to represent a win (1) or a loss (0). Return your balance after playing all rounds.
The Martingale strategy
You start with a stake of 100 dollars. If you lose a round, you lose the stake placed on that round and you double the stake for your next bet. When you win, you win 100% of the stake and revert back to staking 100 dollars on your next bet.
Example
martingale(1000, [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]) === 1300

Explanation:

you win your 1st round: gain $100, balance = 1100
you win the 2nd round: gain $100, balance = 1200
you lose the 3rd round: lose $100 dollars, balance = 1100
double stake for 4th round and lose: staked $200, lose $200, balance = 900
double stake for 5th round and win: staked $400, won $400, balance = 1300

Note: Your balance is allowed to go below 0.

You start with a stake of 100 dollars. If you lose a round, you lose the stake placed on that round and you double the stake for your next bet. When you win, you win 100% of the stake and revert back to staking 100 dollars on your next bet.
Example
martingale(1000, [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]) === 1300

Explanation:

you win your 1st round: gain $100, balance = 1100
you win the 2nd round: gain $100, balance = 1200
you lose the 3rd round: lose $100 dollars, balance = 1100
double stake for 4th round and lose: staked $200, lose $200, balance = 900
double stake for 5th round and win: staked $400, won $400, balance = 1300

Note: Your balance is allowed to go below 0.

Задача:
As you may know, once some people pass their teens, they jokingly only celebrate their 20th or 21st birthday, forever. With some maths skills, that's totally possible - you only need to select the correct number base!
For example, if they turn 32, that's exactly 20 - in base 16... Already 39? That's just 21, in base 19!
Your task is to translate the given age to the much desired 20 (or 21) years, and indicate the number base, in the format specified below.
Note: input will be always > 21
Examples:
32  -->  "32? That's just 20, in base 16!"
39  -->  "39? That's just 21, in base 19!"

Hint: if you don't know (enough) about numeral systems and radix, just observe the pattern!

Задача:
At the casino you are presented with a wide array of games to play. You are there for fun, but you want to be economical about it by playing the game that maximises your profits (minimises your losses, let's be real).
To do this, you will pick the game with the highest expected value (EV). If you are unfamiliar with the concept, you can read the article on investopedia.
You will get a tuple containing instances of namedtuple Game. Each instance of Game has a field name and outcomes. name is just the name of the game represented as a string. outcomes is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple represents a single possible outcome.
Example Game instance:
g1 = Game("Breakeven Steven", ((0.5, 20), (0.5, -20)))

For each outcome (inner tuple), the first value represent the probability of occurrence while the second value represent the reward. In the above example there is a 50% chance of winning 20, and 50% chance of losing 20.
The function which you will construct should return the name of the game with the highest expected value of playing.
Constraints:
2 <= N <= 20
Notes:

Each input has one clear winner.
Namedtuple Game has been preloaded.

Game namedtuple:
Game = namedtuple("Game", ["name", "outcomes"])

Example with explanation:
g1 = Game("Breakeven Steven", ((0.5, 20), (0.5, -20)))
g2 = Game("Go big or go home", ((0.99, -10), (0.01, 980)))

find_best_game((g1, g2)) # => "Breakeven Steven"

Breakeven Steven has a higher EV than Go big or go home (0 vs -0.1) and therefore the function should return that name.

Given the sum and gcd of two numbers, return those two numbers in ascending order. If the numbers do not exist, return -1, (or NULL in C, tuple (-1,-1) in C#, pair (-1,-1) in C++,None in Rust, array {-1,-1}  in Java and Golang).
For example: 
Given sum = 12 and gcd = 4...

solve(12,4) = [4,8]. The two numbers 4 and 8 sum to 12 and have a gcd of 4.

solve(12,5) = -1. No two numbers exist that sum to 12 and have gcd of 5.

solve(10,2) = [2,8]. Note that [4,6] is also a possibility but we pick the one with the lower first element: 2 < 4, so we take [2,8].

More examples in test cases.

solve(12,5) = -1. No two numbers exist that sum to 12 and have gcd of 5.

solve(10,2) = [2,8]. Note that [4,6] is also a possibility but we pick the one with the lower first element: 2 < 4, so we take [2,8].

More examples in test cases. 
Good luck!

Задача:
Traditionally, all programming languages implement the 3 most common boolean operations: and, or, not. These three form the complete boolean algebra, i.e. every possible boolean function from N arguments can be decomposed into combination of arguments and and, or, not.
In the school we have learned, that only 2 operations (not and 1 of remaining) is enough to form a complete algebra, and the last one can be expressed as a combination of the former. A great kata to test that: https://www.codewars.com/kata/boolean-logic-from-scratch/python
Several other operations may form a complete boolean algebra, i.e. xor, 1 and and. However, we are interested in an operation, which forms boolean algebra all by itself: Sheffer stroke (another operation with such a property is Peirce's arrow).
Sheffer stroke is defined as follows:
sheffer(False, False) = True
sheffer(False, True) = True
sheffer(True, False) = True
sheffer(True, True) = False

The task:
Implement functions and, not and or by only using the preloaded sheffer function. Using built-in boolean primitives is disallowed.
Note: for reasons of banning strange solutions, using anonymous functions is also disallowed.

Задача:
Inside of the city there are many gangs, each with differing numbers of members wielding different weapons and possessing different strength levels. The gangs do not really want to fight one another, and so the "If you can't beat 'em, join 'em" rule applies. The gangs start combining with the most powerful gangs being joined by the weaker gangs until there is one gang left.
Challenge:
You are given a list of lists. Inside of the interior lists are numbers. Join the lists together by descending total list value ending up with one final list.
Simple example:
cant_beat_so_join([[1,2], [3,4], [5,6], [7,8], [9]]) -> [7, 8, 5, 6, 9, 3, 4, 1, 2]


In the example above, [7, 8] are the first in the list because they have the highest value


They are followed by [5, 6]
That is followed by [9] which comes before [3, 4] because the list of [9] is greater
It ends with [1, 2] which has the least amount of value

More examples:
cant_beat_so_join([[5, 1],[9, 14],[17, 23],[4, 1],[0, 1]]) -> [17, 23, 9, 14, 5, 1, 4, 1, 0, 1]
cant_beat_so_join([[13, 37], [43, 17], [2,3], [45,64], [1,9]]) -> [45, 64, 43, 17, 13, 37, 1, 9, 2, 3]
cant_beat_so_join([[], [], [], []]) -> []
cant_beat_so_join([[], [], [0], []]) -> [0]
cant_beat_so_join([[1,0,1,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0,1,0,0,1], [0], []]) -> [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]

In the case of more than one list sharing the same sum, place them in the same order that they were in the argument:
cant_beat_so_join([[0,1,1,1], [1,0,1,1], [1,1,0,1], [3]]) -> [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 3]

Задача:
In a far away country called AlgoLandia, there are N islands numbered 1 to N. Each island is denoted by k[i]. King Algolas, king of AlgoLandia, built N - 1 bridges in the country. A bridge is built between islands k[i] and k[i+1]. Bridges are two-ways and are expensive to build.
The problem is that there are gangs who wants to destroy the bridges. In order to protect the bridges, the king wants to assign elite guards to the bridges. A bridge between islands k[i] and k[i+1] is safe when there is an elite guard in island k[i] or k[i+1]. There are already elite guards assigned in some islands.
Your task now is to determine the minimum number of additional elite guards that needs to be hired to guard all the bridges.
Note:
You are given a sequence k with N length.
k[i] = true, means that there is an elite guard in that island; k[i] = false means no elite guard. It is guaranteed that AlgoLandia have at least 2 islands.
Sample Input 1
k = [true, true, false, true, false]

Задача:
In this Kata, we will check if a string contains consecutive letters as they appear in the English alphabet and if each letter occurs only once. 
Rules are: (1) the letters are adjacent in the English alphabet, and (2) each letter occurs only once.

For example: 
solve("abc") = True, because it contains a,b,c
solve("abd") = False, because a, b, d are not consecutive/adjacent in the alphabet, and c is missing.

Задача:
In this Kata, we will check if a string contains consecutive letters as they appear in the English alphabet and if each letter occurs only once. 
Rules are: (1) the letters are adjacent in the English alphabet, and (2) each letter occurs only once.

For example: 
solve("abc") = True, because it contains a,b,c
solve("abd") = False, because a, b, d are not consecutive/adjacent in the alphabet, and c is missing.
solve("dabc") = True, because it contains a, b, c, d
solve("abbc") = False, because b does not occur once.
solve("v") = True

All inputs will be lowercase letters.

Задача:
A stem-and-leaf plot groups data points that have the same leading digit, resembling a histogram. For example, for the input [11, 35, 14, 9, 39, 23, 35], it might look something like this:
stem | leaf
-----------
  0  | 9
  1  | 1 4
  2  | 3
  3  | 5 5 9

Some important things to notice: 

Any single-digit number, such as 9, has 0 as its stem; 
The leaves are presented in ascending order; 
Leaves can be repeated (as with the two 5's in the last row).

Create a function called stem_and_leaf that, given a list of integers i as input (0 <= i <= 99), returns a Python dictionary containing a stem-and-leaf plot. Each key of the dictionary should be a stem and each value should be a list of leaves, following the format above.
For the example above, the output would be:
{0: [9], 1: [1, 4], 2: [3], 3: [5, 5, 9]}

Scenario
A construction master applies specific rules when creating walls. But the construction master cannot calculate the exact number of bricks to be spent on the walls.
For this reason, you are expected to write a method that calculates the number of bricks that need to be spent for the wall whose width and height are clear.
Rules

Only 3 kinds of bricks can be used. Large Brick(60 cm), 
Medium Brick(40 cm) and Small Brick(20cm)
The height of all bricks is 5 cm and wall height is always 5 cm and multiples.
The Wall width is always 60 cm and multiples.
The lowest row should be composed of only large bricks.
After that, the first brick from the right of the next row must be the middle brick, the first brick from the left is the small brick.
Finally, The first brick from the right of the next row must be the small brick, the first brick from the left is the medium brick.
The first row after the series is completed again consists of large bricks and the cycle continues.
The number of bricks used should return to the following format. 
"21L6M6S"
If number of medium and small bricks is 0, then answer should be the following format. "21L"

Example Wall

Wall height is 45 cm and wall width is 180 cm.
There are 21 large bricks. (Yellow bricks)
There are 6 medium bricks. (Green bricks)
There are 6 small bricks. (Pink bricks)
So answer is "21L6M6S"

Welcome to yet another kata on palindromes!
Your job is to return a string with 2 requirements:
1 . The first half of the string should represent a proper function expression in your chosen language.
2 . The string should be a palindrome.
Wait... that's too easy -- let's add one more requirement:
Call x the sum of the character codes of the full string we want to return.
To pass the kata, make sure the function represented in your string will return x when it is given as an input.

1 . The first half of the string should represent a proper function expression in your chosen language.
2 . The string should be a palindrome.
Wait... that's too easy -- let's add one more requirement:
Call x the sum of the character codes of the full string we want to return.
To pass the kata, make sure the function represented in your string will return x when it is given as an input.

Task
You are given a positive integer n. We intend to make some ascending sequences according to the following rules:

Make a sequence of length 1: [ n ]

Or, insert a number to the left side of the sequence. But this number can not exceed half of the first number of the sequence. 

Follow rule 2, continue insert number to the left side of the sequence.


Your task is to count the number of all possible sequences, and return it.
If you do not understand the task, please read the rewritten version below:
You are given a positive integer n. Your task is to count the number of such sequences: 

It should be an ascending sequence;

It should end with number n.

Each number in the sequence should smaller or equals to the half of its right, except for the last number n.

We define that a sequence containing only a number n is a valid ascending sequence.


Examples
For n = 6, the output should be 6.
All sequences we made are:
[6]

insert a number to the left:

[1,6]
[2,6]

Задача:
We have two consecutive integers k1 and k2, k2 = k1 + 1
We need to calculate the lowest strictly positive integer n, such that:
the values nk1 and nk2 have the same digits but in different order.
E.g.# 1:
k1 = 100
k2 = 101
n = 8919
#Because 8919 * 100 = 891900 
and      8919 * 101 = 900819

E.g.# 2:
k1 = 325
k2 = 326
n = 477
#Because 477 * 325 = 155025
and      477 * 326 = 155502

Your task is to prepare a function that will receive the value of k and outputs the value of n.
The examples given above will be:
find_lowest_int(100) === 8919
find_lowest_int(325) ===  477

Features of the random tests
10 < k < 10.000.000.000.000.000 (For Python, Ruby and Haskell)
10 < k < 1.000.000.000  (For Javascript and D 1e9)

Задача:
Ronny the robot is watching someone perform the Cups and Balls magic trick. The magician has one ball and three cups, he shows Ronny which cup he hides the ball under (b), he then mixes all the cups around by performing multiple two-cup switches (arr). Ronny can record the switches but can't work out where the ball is. Write a programme to help him do this. 
Rules: 

There will only ever be three cups.
Only two cups will be swapped at a time. 
The cups and their switches will be refered to by their index in a row of three, beginning at one. So [[1,2]] means the cup at position one, is swapped with the cup at position two. 
Arr will be an array of integers 1 - 3 organised in pairs. 
There won't be any empty sub-arrays.
If arr is just an empty array b should be returned.

Examples: 
(b) = 2, 
(arr) = [[1,2]]
The ball is under cup number : 1

(b) = 1, 
(arr) = [[2,3],[1,2],[1,2]]
The ball is under cup number : 1

(b) = 2, 
(arr) = [[1,3],[1,2],[2,1],[2,3]]
The ball is under cup number : 3

You have a string of numbers; starting with the third number each number is the result of an operation performed using the previous two numbers.
Complete the function which returns a string of the operations in order and separated by a comma and a space, e.g. "subtraction, subtraction, addition"
The available operations are (in this order of preference):
1) addition
2) subtraction
3) multiplication
4) division

Notes:

All input data is valid
The number of numbers in the input string >= 3
For a case like "2 2 4" - when multiple variants are possible - choose the first possible operation from the list (in this case "addition")
Integer division should be used

Example
"9 4 5 20 25"  -->  "subtraction, multiplication, addition"

Because:
9 - 4 = 5   --> subtraction
4 * 5 = 20  --> multiplication

9 - 4 = 5   --> subtraction
4 * 5 = 20  --> multiplication
5 + 20 = 25 --> addition

Задача:
Create a Circular List
A circular list is of finite size, but can infititely be asked for its previous and next elements. This is because it acts like it is joined at the ends and loops around.
For example, imagine a CircularList of [1, 2, 3, 4]. Five invocations of next() in a row should return 1, 2, 3, 4 and then 1 again. At this point, five invocations of prev() in a row should return 4, 3, 2, 1 and then 4 again.
Your CircularList is created by passing a vargargs parameter in, e.g. new CircularList(1, 2, 3). Your list constructor/init code should throw an Exception if nothing is passed in.

Задача:
Background:
In Japan, a game called Shiritori is played. The rules are simple, a group of people take turns calling out a word whose beginning syllable is the same as the previous player's ending syllable. For example, the first person would say the word ねこ, and the second player must make a word that starts with こ, like　こむぎ. This repeats until a player can not think of a word fast enough or makes a word that ends in ん, because there are no words that begin with ん　in the Japanese language.
English Shiritori has the same principle, with the first and last letters of words. That being said the lose condition is saying a word that doesn't start with the previous word's last letter or not saying a word quick enough. 
For example: apple -> eggs -> salmon -> nut -> turkey ...
Your Task:
You will be given a list of strings, a transcript of an English Shiritori match. Your task is to find out if the game ended early, and return a list that contains every valid string until the mistake. If a list is empty return an empty list. If one of the elements is an empty string, that is invalid and should be handled. 

Examples:
All elements valid:
The array {"dog","goose","elephant","tiger","rhino","orc","cat"}
should return {"dog","goose","elephant","tiger","rhino","orc","cat"}
An invalid element at index 2:
The array {"dog","goose","tiger","cat", "elephant","rhino","orc"} 
should return ("dog","goose") 
since goose ends in 'e' and tiger starts with 't'
An invalid empty string at index 2:
The array {"ab","bc","","cd"} 
should return ("ab","bc")
All invalid empty string at index 0:
The array {"","bc","","cd"} 
should return An Empty List

Задача:
You are given a length of string and two thumbtacks. On thumbtack goes into the focus point F₀ with coordinates x₀ and y₀, and the other does into point F₁ with points x₁ and y₁. The string is then tied at the ends to the thumbtacks and has length l excluding the knots at the ends. If you pull the string taught with a pencil and draw around the plane you'll have an ellipse with focuses at F₀ and F₁. Given a new point P, determine if it falls inside of the ellipse.
You must write a function that takes arguments f0, f1, l, and p and returns true or false depending on whether or not p falls inside the ellipse. 
Each of f0, f1, and p has has properties x and y for its coordinates.
You will never be given the case where the string is too short to reach between the points.

Задача:
Quadratic equations come in the form y(x) = ax^2 + bx + c. Substituting in different values of x gives us different coordinates/points on the graph of the given quadratic function.
Task:
Your job is to create a function that does the following:

Takes in three required parameters: a, b, and c, and two keyword/optional parameters, start and step. If start is not provided, it should be set as default to 0, and if step is not provided, its default value should be 1 (all of them will be passed in JS when needed).
It should return an enumerator/generator which is dynamic and created based on the arguments taken in.

What the enumerator/generator must do:
Essentially, the method you write should return an enumerator/generator which, when called, should start by yielding [start, a(start)^2 + b(start) + c], where a, b, and c, are provided when the method was called. Then start should be incremented by step and continue the sequence.

Задача:
7 Wonders
7 Wonders is a board game that consists of building your city, gathering resources and fighting your neighbors.
One part of the game is also to research science in order to gain points at the end of the game.
There are 3 types of science glyphs you can gather:

Compasses
Gears
Tablets

The way points are added up works as described here:
Step 1
Each distinct set of three different glyphs is worth 7 points:
1 Compass, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet    =  7 points
2 Compasses, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet  =  7 points (because it's just one disctinct set)

Note that a distinct set of three different glyphs means 1 Compass, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet. No more, no less!
Step 2
The amount of each glyph you own is squared and then summed up:
1 Compass, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet    =  1*1 + 1*1 + 1*1  =  3 points
2 Compasses, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet  =  2*2 + 1*1 + 1*1  =  6 points

Finally
The total science points is equal to the sum of the two steps:
1 Compass, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet    =  7 + 3  =  10 points
2 Compasses, 1 Gear and 1 Tablet  =  7 + 6  =  13 points

You will be given 3 inputs corresponding to the amount of each glyph you have acquired in the game. Your task is to output the final score.
Take into account that you may have no glyphs at all!

Задача:
This is a problem that involves adding numbers to items in a list. In a list you will have to add the item's remainder when divided by a given divisor to each item.
For example if the item is 40 and the divisor is 3 you would have to add 1 since 40 minus the closest multiple of 3 which is 39 is 1. So the 40 in the list will become 41. You would have to return the modified list in this problem.
For this problem you will receive a divisor called div as well as simple list of whole numbers called nums. Good luck and happy coding.
Examples
nums = [2, 7, 5, 9, 100, 34, 32, 0], div = 3
  ==>  [4, 8, 7, 9, 101, 35, 34, 0] 

nums = [1000, 999, 998, 997], div = 5
   ==> [1000, 1003, 1001, 999]

nums = [], div = 2
   ==> []

Note: random tests check lists containing up to 10000 elements.

Задача:
Mr Leicester's cheese factory is the pride of the East Midlands, but he's feeling a little blue. It's the time of the year when the taxman is coming round to take a slice of his cheddar - and the final thing he has to work out is how much money he's spending on his staff. Poor Mr Leicester can barely sleep he's so stressed. Can you help? 

Mr Leicester employs 4 staff, who together make 10 wheels of cheese every 6 minutes.
Worker pay is calculated on how many wheels of cheese they produce in a day. 
Mr Leicester pays his staff according to the UK living wage, which is currently £8.75p an hour. There are 100 pence (p) to the UK pound (£).

The input for function payCheese will be provided as an array of five integers, one for each amount of cheese wheels produced each day.
When the workforce don't work a nice integer number of minutes - much to the chagrin of the company accountant - Mr Leicester very generously rounds up to the nearest hour at the end of the week (not the end of each day). Which means if the workers make 574 wheels on each day of the week, they're each paid 29 hours for the week (28.699 hours rounded up) and not 30 (6 hours a day rounded up * 5).
The return value should be a string (with the £ included) of the total £ of staff wages for that week.

Mr Leicester pays his staff according to the UK living wage, which is currently £8.75p an hour. There are 100 pence (p) to the UK pound (£).

The input for function payCheese will be provided as an array of five integers, one for each amount of cheese wheels produced each day.
When the workforce don't work a nice integer number of minutes - much to the chagrin of the company accountant - Mr Leicester very generously rounds up to the nearest hour at the end of the week (not the end of each day). Which means if the workers make 574 wheels on each day of the week, they're each paid 29 hours for the week (28.699 hours rounded up) and not 30 (6 hours a day rounded up * 5).
The return value should be a string (with the £ included) of the total £ of staff wages for that week.

Задача:
Mr Leicester's cheese factory is the pride of the East Midlands, but he's feeling a little blue. It's the time of the year when the taxman is coming round to take a slice of his cheddar - and the final thing he has to work out is how much money he's spending on his staff. Poor Mr Leicester can barely sleep he's so stressed. Can you help?

Story
The construction of the new Death Star is almost complete. It only needs a certain amount of 3 materials – iron, steel, and chromium. The emperor wants the construction finished within a week because he senses an impending rebel attack and knows the battle station will be destroyed if it is not completed within this timeframe. He has already ordered enough material delivered to the station within a week. The problem is, the rebels are attacking the supply routes and there are different amounts of material arriving at the station each week. Will the station be ready in time or will it be destroyed?
Task
The required resources are:

100 Gt of iron
75 Gt of steel
50 Gt of chromium

The input will consist of an array with 8 elements:

The first 7 elements are the shipments - 3-elements-long arrays where each number corresponds to the amount of material that was ordered (iron, steel, and chromium)
The last element is a number representing the day of the rebel attack (0-indexed) - any materials which should have been delivered that day will be lost, and later shipments will be cancelled due to the trading route becoming unsafe

The output will be one of the two possible string:

In case enough resources were delivered before the attack, return "The station is completed!"
Otherwise, return "The station is destroyed! It needed X iron, Y steel and Z chromium for completion.", where X, Y and Z are the quantities of the respective material

Задача:
In this Kata, you will check if it is possible to convert a string to a palindrome by changing one character. 
For instance:
solve ("abbx") = True, because we can convert 'x' to 'a' and get a palindrome. 
solve ("abba") = False, because we cannot get a palindrome by changing any character. 
solve ("abcba") = True. We can change the middle character. 
solve ("aa") = False 
solve ("ab") = True

Good luck!
Please also try Single Character Palindromes

Задача:
You are trying to cross a river by jumping along stones. Every time you land on a stone, you hop forwards by the value of that stone. If you skip over a stone then its value doesn't affect you in any way. Eg:
 x--x-----x-->
[1][2][5][1]

Of course, crossing from the other side might give you a different answer:
 <--------x--x
   [1][2][5][1]

Given an array of positive integers, return the total number of steps it would take to go all the way across the river (and past the end of the array) and then all the way back. All arrays will contain at least one element, and may contain up to 100 elements. 
Examples
  x--x-----x-->
 [1][2][1][2]
<----x-----x

therefore hop_across([1,2,1,2]) = 3 + 2 = 5

   x-----x--------x------>
  [2][2][3][1][1][2][1]
<--------x--x-----x--x

therefore hop_across([2,2,3,1,1,2,1]) = 3 + 4 = 7

Задача:
A balanced number is a number where the sum of digits to the left of the middle digit(s) and the sum of digits to the right of the middle digit(s) are equal.
If the number has an odd number of digits, then there is only one middle digit. (For example, 92645 has one middle digit, 6.) Otherwise, there are two middle digits. (For example, the middle digits of 1301 are 3 and 0.)
The middle digit(s) should not be considered when determining whether a number is balanced or not, e.g. 413023 is a balanced number because the left sum and right sum are both 5.
The task
Given a number, find if it is balanced, and return the string "Balanced" or "Not Balanced" accordingly. The passed number will always be positive.
Examples

7 ==> return "Balanced"

Explanation:


middle digit(s): 7
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 0
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 0
0 and 0 are equal, so it's balanced.


295591 ==> return "Not Balanced"

Explanation:


middle digit(s): 55
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 11
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 10
11 and 10 are not equal, so it's not balanced.


959 ==> return "Balanced"

Explanation:


middle digit(s): 5
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 9
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 9
9 and 9 are equal, so it's balanced.

Explanation:


middle digit(s): 02
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 10
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 20
10 and 20 are not equal, so it's not balanced.

9 and 9 are equal, so it's balanced.


27102983 ==> return "Not Balanced"

Explanation:


middle digit(s): 02
sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) -> 10
sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) -> 20
10 and 20 are not equal, so it's not balanced.

Задача:
The citizens of Codeland read each word from right to left, meaning that lexicographical comparison works differently in their language. Namely, string a is lexicographically smaller than string b if either: a is a suffix of b (in common sense, i.e. b ends with a substring equal to a); or their last k characters are the same but the (k + 1)th character from the right in string a is smaller than the same character in string b.
Given an array of words in Codeland language, sort them lexicographically according to Codeland's unique rules.
For words = ["nigeb", "ta", "eht", "gninnigeb"], the output should be
unusualLexOrder(words) = ["ta", "nigeb", "gninnigeb", "eht"].
In particular, "ta" < "nigeb" because 'a' < 'b' and "nigeb" < "gninnigeb" because the former word is a suffix of the latter.

Задача:
This is a simplified version of Racing #2: Accelerated Drag Race.
Anna and Bob are good friends, but also rival drag racers.
Bob just got his engine reconditioned and wants to prove that he is the fastest of the two.
In this kata, you will simulate a drag race between Anna and Bob and determine the winner.
You will do this by implementing the function dragRace (or drag_race in Python).
Input
You are given the length of the track in meters (len in JavaScript, length in Python).
Also, you are given the two competing cars (anna and bob).
The cars are Car objects. In JavaScript, they have the following properties.
speed        -> the speed of the car in m/s
reactionTime -> the reaction time of its driver in s

In Python, these are the properties of Car objects.
speed         -> the speed of the car in m/s
reaction_time -> the reaction time of its driver in s

The reaction time indicates how long it takes before the driver starts to drive after the start of the race.
For example if Anna has a reaction time of 1s, and Bob has a reaction time of 2s, Bob starts driving one second later than Anna.
The cars do not require any time to accelerate to their speed. In other words, the cars go from zero to their speed in literally no time.
Output
If there is no winner, return the string It's a draw.
If there is a winner, return the string [name] is the winner.

The booleans should always start with false becase there is no digit before the first one.
Examples
73312        => [false, false, true, false, true]
2026         => [false, true, false, true]
635          => [false, false, false]

*** Remember 0 is evenly divisible by all integers but not the other way around ***

Take debugging to a whole new level:
Given a string, remove every single bug.
This means you must remove all instances of the word 'bug' from within a given string, unless the word is plural ('bugs').
For example, given 'obugobugobuoobugsoo', you should return 'ooobuoobugsoo'.
Another example: given 'obbugugo', you should return 'obugo'.
Note that all characters will be lowercase.

Complete the function that counts the number of unique consonants in a string (made up of printable ascii characters).
Consonants are letters used in English other than "a", "e", "i", "o", "u". 
Remember, your function needs to return the number of unique consonants - disregarding duplicates. For example, if the string passed into the function reads "add", the function should return 1 rather than 2, since "d" is a duplicate.
Similarly, the function should also disregard duplicate consonants of differing cases. For example, "Dad" passed into the function should return 1 as "d" and "D" are duplicates.
Examples
"add" ==> 1
"Dad" ==> 1
"aeiou" ==> 0
"sillystring" ==> 7
"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" ==> 21
"Count my unique consonants!!" ==> 7

Задача:
An array is a data structure in which a collection of different data stored continuously in memory. This collection is usually accessed by a numerical index and allows near instant access to all of the data held by the array as opposed to other structures such as binary search trees or linked lists, where the computer has to traverse these structures to find the item being accessed.
To demonstrate, we'll calculate the position of an array element using some simple arithmetic.
Task Overview
Given:

begin, a number which represents the location of the beginning of the array in memory,
end, a number which represents the location of the end of the array in memory,
index, a zero-based numerical key for the element being accessed,
size, a number representing the size in bytes of each item of the array,

Return the memory address of the element being accessed.
If the index is negative or the address of the memory being accessed is at or greater than the end of the array, throw an Error (JS) / IndexError (Python). In C return NULL instead.
Otherwise, who knows what data we could be accessing!
Usage Example
elementLocation(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x3, 0x8) => 0x1018
elementLocation(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x8, 0x8) // throws Error
elementLocation(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x3, 0x4) => 0x200C
elementLocation(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x0, 0x4) => 0x2000

element_location(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x3, 0x8) => 0x1018
element_location(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x8, 0x8) # throws IndexError
element_location(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x3, 0x4) => 0x200C
element_location(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x0, 0x4) => 0x2000

element_location(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x3, 0x8) => 0x1018
element_location(0x1000, 0x1040, 0x8, 0x8) => NULL
element_location(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x3, 0x4) => 0x200C
element_location(0x2000, 0x2100, 0x0, 0x4) => 0x2000

Constraints

All types given will be valid.
All numbers given are integers.
end will be greater than or equal to begin
begin, end, and size will be positive numbers.
size will be a power of 2.
begin is evenly divisible by 4.

Задача:
Timothy (age: 16) really likes to smoke. Unfortunately, he is too young to buy his own cigarettes and that's why he has to be extremely efficient in smoking.
It's now your task to create a function that calculates how many cigarettes Timothy can smoke out of the given amounts of bars and boxes:

a bar has 10 boxes of cigarettes,
a box has 18 cigarettes,
out of 5 stubs (cigarettes ends) Timothy is able to roll a new one,
of course the self made cigarettes also have an end which can be used to create a new one...

Please note that Timothy never starts smoking cigarettes that aren't "full size" so the amount of smoked cigarettes is always an integer.

Create a function that takes any sentence and redistributes the spaces (and adds additional spaces if needed) so that each word starts with a vowel. The letters should all be in the same order but every vowel in the sentence should be the start of a new word. The first word in the new sentence may start without a vowel. It should return a string in all lowercase with no punctuation (only alphanumeric characters).

Задача:
A trick I learned in elementary school to determine whether or not a number was divisible by three is to add all of the integers in the number together and to divide the resulting sum by three. If there is no remainder from dividing the sum by three, then the original number is divisible by three as well.
Given a series of digits as a string, determine if the number represented by the string is divisible by three.
Example:
"123"      -> true
"8409"     -> true
"100853"   -> false
"33333333" -> true
"7"        -> false

Try to avoid using the % (modulo) operator.

Imagine you start on the 5th floor of a building, then travel down to the 2nd floor, then back up to the 8th floor. You have travelled a total of 3 + 6 = 9 floors of distance.
Given an array representing a series of floors you must reach by elevator, return an integer representing the total distance travelled for visiting each floor in the array in order. 
// simple examples
elevatorDistance([5,2,8]) = 9
elevatorDistance([1,2,3]) = 2

It happened decades before Snapchat, years before Twitter and even before Facebook. Targeted advertising was a bit of a challenge back then. One day, the marketing professor at my university told us a story that I am yet to confirm using reliable sources. Nevertheless, I retold the story to dozens of my students already, so, sorry BMW if it is all a big lie.
Allegedly, BMW, in an attempt to target the educated, produced billboard posters featuring the English alphabet with three letters missing: B, M and W. Needless to say, many were confused, some to the extent of road accidents.
Your task is to write a function that takes one parameter str that MUST be a string and removes all capital and small letters B, M and W.If data of the wrong data type was sent as a parameter the function must throw an error with the following specific message: 
TypeError("This program only works for text.")

new Error("This program only works for text.");

"This program only works for text."

new IllegalArgumentException("This program only works for text.")

For Python here's a good resource you might need for the exception type ;)

Задача:
It happened decades before Snapchat, years before Twitter and even before Facebook. Targeted advertising was a bit of a challenge back then. One day, the marketing professor at my university told us a story that I am yet to confirm using reliable sources. Nevertheless, I retold the story to dozens of my students already, so, sorry BMW if it is all a big lie.
Allegedly, BMW, in an attempt to target the educated, produced billboard posters featuring the English alphabet with three letters missing: B, M and W. Needless to say, many were confused, some to the extent of road accidents.
Your task is to write a function that takes one parameter str that MUST be a string and removes all capital and small letters B, M and W.If data of the wrong data type was sent as a parameter the function must throw an error with the following specific message: 
TypeError("This program only works for text.")

new Error("This program only works for text.");

"This program only works for text."

new IllegalArgumentException("This program only works for text.")

Задача:
The Menger Sponge is a three-dimensional fractal, first described by Karl Menger in 1926.

An illustration of the iterative construction of a Menger sponge
A method of constructing a Menger Sponge can be visualized as follows:

Start from a cube (first part of image).
Scale down the cube so that side length is 1/3 of its original, and make 20 copies of it.
Place the copies so that they measure the same size as the original cube but without its central parts (next part of image)
Repeat the process from step 2 for the new smaller cubes from the previous step.
In each iteration (e.g. repeating the last three steps), the effect will be that parts of the cube will be removed, they'll never be added. Menger sponge will always consist of parts will never be removed, regardless of how many iterations you do.


An alternative explanation:

Start from a cube (first part of image).
Devide each cube into 27 equal sized cubes.
Remove the middle-cube and the six cubes on each side of the group of 27 cubes (second part of image).
Repeat the process from step 2 for the smaller cubes (third and fourth part of image).

Task
In this kata you will create a function that takes non negative integers (from 0 to n) and return the amount of cubes that the Menger Sponge would have in that specific iteration.
Example
For n = 0, the ouptut should be 1;
For n = 1, the output should be 20;
For n = 2, the output should be 400;
For n = 3, the output should be 8000;
for n = 4, the output should be 160000;
For n = 5, the output should be 3200000;
For n = 6, the output should be 64000000.

Simple interest on a loan is calculated by simply taking the initial amount (the principal, p) and multiplying it by a rate of interest (r) and the number of time periods (n). 
Compound interest is calculated by adding the interest after each time period to the amount owed, then calculating the next interest payment based on the principal PLUS the interest from all previous periods.
Given a principal p, interest rate r, and a number of periods n, return an array [ total owed under simple interest, total owed under compound interest ]
Notes:

Round all answers to the nearest integer
Principal will always be an integer between 0 and 9999
interest rate will be a decimal between 0 and 1
number of time periods will be an integer between 0 and 50

Examples
interest(100, 0.1,  1)  =  [110, 110]

Задача:
My friend wants a new band name for her band. She like bands that use the formula: "The" + a noun with the first letter capitalized, for example:
"dolphin" -> "The Dolphin"
However, when a noun STARTS and ENDS with the same letter, she likes to repeat the noun twice and connect them together with the first and last letter, combined into one word (WITHOUT "The" in front), like this:
"alaska" -> "Alaskalaska"
Complete the function that takes a noun as a string, and returns her preferred band name written as a string.

Задача:
Implement a function which takes a string, and returns its hash value.
Algorithm steps:

a := sum of the ascii values of the input characters
b := sum of every difference between the consecutive characters of the input (second char minus first char, third minus second, ...)
c := (a OR b) AND ((NOT a) shift left by 2 bits)
d := c XOR (32 * (total_number_of_spaces + 1))
return d

Note: OR, AND, NOT, XOR are bitwise operations.

Examples
input = "a"
a = 97
b = 0
result = 64

input = "ca"
a = 196
b = -2
result = -820


Give an example why this hashing algorithm is bad?

Task
In the field, two beggars A and B found some gold at the same time. They all wanted the gold, and they decided to use simple rules to distribute gold:
They divided gold into n piles and be in line. 
The amount of each pile and the order of piles all are randomly.

They took turns to take away a pile of gold from the 
far left or the far right.

They always choose the bigger pile. That is to say, 
if the left is 1, the right is 2, then choose to take 2.

If the both sides are equal, take the left pile.

Given an integer array golds, and assume that A always takes first. Please calculate the final amount of gold obtained by A and B. returns a two-element array [amount of A, amount of B].
Example
For golds = [4,2,9,5,2,7], the output should be [14,15].
The pile of most left is 4, 
The pile of most right is 7, 
A choose the largest one -- > take 7

Задача:
Task
In the field, two beggars A and B found some gold at the same time. They all wanted the gold, and they decided to use simple rules to distribute gold:
They divided gold into n piles and be in line. 
The amount of each pile and the order of piles all are randomly.

They took turns to take away a pile of gold from the 
far left or the far right.

They always choose the bigger pile. That is to say, 
if the left is 1, the right is 2, then choose to take 2.

If the both sides are equal, take the left pile.

Given an integer array golds, and assume that A always takes first. Please calculate the final amount of gold obtained by A and B. returns a two-element array [amount of A, amount of B].
Example
For golds = [4,2,9,5,2,7], the output should be [14,15].
The pile of most left is 4, 
The pile of most right is 7,

Задача:
A byte is a sequence of 8 bits. One could imagine implementing a small set data structure using a single byte. The set would hold at most the elements 0 through 7. The value of each bit in the byte would indicate whether the index of that bit was included in the set.
Consider the following byte, where the index of each bit is marked below.
Byte:  0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1
Index: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
This byte would represent the set {1, 2, 5, 7}. Similarly,
10101010 ==> {0, 2, 4, 6}
11100000 ==> {0, 1, 2}
Your task is to write a function byte_to_set which takes a single byte (an integer 0-255), and returns the corresponding set.
>> byte_to_set(0)
set()

>> byte_to_set(255)
{0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7}

>> byte_to_set(3)
{6,7}

The GADERYPOLUKI is a simple substitution cypher used in scouting to encrypt messages. The encryption is based on short, easy to remember key. The key is written as paired letters, which are in the cipher simple replacement.
The most frequently used key is "GA-DE-RY-PO-LU-KI".
 G => A
 g => a
 a => g
 A => G
 D => E
  etc.

The letters, which are not on the list of substitutes, stays in the encrypted text without changes.
Task
Your task is to help scouts to encrypt and decrypt thier messages.
Write the Encode and Decode functions.
Input/Output
The input string consists of lowercase and uperrcase characters and white .
The substitution has to be case-sensitive. 
Example
 Encode("ABCD")          // => GBCE 
 Encode("Ala has a cat") // => Gug hgs g cgt 
 Encode("gaderypoluki"); // => agedyropulik
 Decode("Gug hgs g cgt") // => Ala has a cat 
 Decode("agedyropulik")  // => gaderypoluki

Задача:
Task
Ram lives in a house which is round in shape. The house has n entrances numbered from 1 to n. For each i in range 1..n-1 entrances i and i + 1 are adjacent; entrances 1 and n are also adjacent.
Ram's flat is located at entrance a. Each evening he goes for a walk around the house, counting the entrances he walks by. Today Ram decided to walk until he counts b entrances.
Help Ram to determine the number of the entrance near which he will be at the end of his walk.
Input/Output
Input:

integer n - The number of entrances, 1 ≤ n ≤ 200
integer a - The number of the entrance where Ram starts his walk, 1 ≤ a ≤ n
integer b - The number of entrances Ram wants to count, -100 000 ≤ b ≤ 100 000

Note:

if b > 0, Ram walks clockwise until he counts b entrances
if b < 0, Ram walks counterclockwise until he counts b entrances
if b = 0, Ram stays at his entrance and doesn't go anywhere

Output:

an integer - The number of the house at the end of his walk.

Examples
For n = 5, a = 1 and b = 3, the output should be 4: Ram will walk clockwise around the house, counting the entrances as follows: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
For n = 6, a = 2 and b = -5, the output should be 3: 
Ram will walk counterclockwise around the house, so he will count the entrances as follows: 2 -> 1 -> 6 -> 5 -> 4 -> 3

Задача:
Task
Your friend has invited you to watch a tennis match at a local sports club. Since tennis isn't your favorite sport, you get bored right at the start of the first game and start looking for something to keep yourself entertained. Noticing the scoreboard, you realize you don't even know how many points have been won since the game started, so you decided to calculate this number. Given the current score, your goal is to find the number of points won in the current game.
If you are not familiar with tennis rules, here's a short description of its scoring system. Score calling is unique in tennis: each point has a corresponding call that is different from its point value. The table of points won and corresponding calls is given below.
+----------------------+--------------------+
| Number of points won | Corresponding call |
+----------------------+--------------------+
|          0           |      "love"        |
+----------------------+--------------------+
|          1           |       "15"         |
+----------------------+--------------------+
|          2           |       "30"         |
+----------------------+--------------------+
|          3           |       "40"         |
+----------------------+--------------------+

There's an additional rule to remember: when players are tied by one or two points, the score is described as "15-all" and "30-all", respectively.
It's guaranteed that no more than 5 points have been won so far, and the game is not over yet. It is also guaranteed that at least one point has been won.
Input/Output
[input] string score
A string in the format <p1>-<p2> representing a valid score, where <p1> is the first player's score, and <p2> is the second player's score.
[output] an integer
The number of points won so far.
Example
For score = "15-40", the output should be 4.
The first player won 1 point, and the second 3, so 1 + 3 = 4 points have been won.
For score = "30-all", the output should be 4.
The players have won 2 points each.

There's an additional rule to remember: when players are tied by one or two points, the score is described as "15-all" and "30-all", respectively.
It's guaranteed that no more than 5 points have been won so far, and the game is not over yet. It is also guaranteed that at least one point has been won.
Input/Output
[input] string score
A string in the format <p1>-<p2> representing a valid score, where <p1> is the first player's score, and <p2> is the second player's score.
[output] an integer
The number of points won so far.
Example
For score = "15-40", the output should be 4.
The first player won 1 point, and the second 3, so 1 + 3 = 4 points have been won.
For score = "30-all", the output should be 4.
The players have won 2 points each.

Task
Your friend has invited you to watch a tennis match at a local sports club. Since tennis isn't your favorite sport, you get bored right at the start of the first game and start looking for something to keep yourself entertained. Noticing the scoreboard, you realize you don't even know how many points have been won since the game started, so you decided to calculate this number. Given the current score, your goal is to find the number of points won in the current game.
If you are not familiar with tennis rules, here's a short description of its scoring system. Score calling is unique in tennis: each point has a corresponding call that is different from its point value. The table of points won and corresponding calls is given below.
+----------------------+--------------------+
| Number of points won | Corresponding call |
+----------------------+--------------------+
|          0           |      "love"        |

Задача:
Frank just bought a new calculator.
But, this is no normal calculator. 
This is a 'Sticky Calculator.
Whenever you add add, subtract, multiply or divide two numbers the two numbers first stick together: 
For instance: 
50 + 12 becomes 5012

and then the operation is carried out as usual: 
(5012) + 12 = 5024

Task
It is your job to create a function which takes 3 parameters:
stickyCalc(operation, val1, val2)

which works just like Frank's sticky calculator
Some Examples
stickyCalc('+', 50, 12)     // Output: (5012 + 12) = 5024
stickyCalc('-', 7, 5)       // Output: (75 - 5) = 70
stickyCalc('*', 13, 20)     // Output: (1320 * 20 ) = 26400
stickyCalc('/', 10, 10)     // Output: (1010 / 10) = 101

Note

The calculator only works for positive integers only.
The calculator rounds any non-integer before operating.
The calculator rounds any output to nearest integer.

For example: 
stickyCalc('/', 12.1, 6.8), 18);   

12.1 and 6.8 are rounded to 12 and 7 respectively & they 'stick together' to make 127. 
Although 127 / 7 = 18.1428 ; 18 is outputted instead.

Задача:
Hi guys, welcome to introduction to DocTesting.
The kata is composed of two parts; in part (1) we write three small functions, and in part (2) we write a few doc tests for those functions.
Lets talk about the functions first...
The reverse_list function takes a list and returns the reverse of it.
If given an empty list, simply return an empty list.

The second function...
The sum_list function takes a list as input and adds up all the values, 
returning an integer. If the list is empty, return 0.

The third function...
The head_of_list function simply returns the first item in the list.
If the list is empty return None.

Each of these functions can be easily written with a single line of code; there are some tests for correctness but no tests for effciency.
Once you have implemented all three of these functions you can move onto phase two, which is writing doc tests. If you haven't written doc tests before then I suggest you check out the following documentation: 
https://docs.python.org/3/library/doctest.html
To complete this kata all you have to do is write EXACTLY TWO doc tests for each of the three functions (any more/less than that and you will fail the tests).
Here is an example:
def double(y):
  """Function returns y * 2
  >>> double(2)
  4
  """
  return y * 2

In the example above we have a function called 'double' and a single doctest. When we run the doctest module Python will check if double(2) equals 4. If it does not, then the doctest module will flag up an error.
Please note that this is intended as a beginners introduction to docstrings, if you try to do something clever (such as writing doc tests to catch exceptions, or tinkering with the 'option flags'), you will probably fail a test or two. This is due to how the tests are written.  
Oh and one last thing, don't try and get too 'cheeky' and try something like:
"""
>>> True
True
"""

such a solution is (a) not in the spirit of things and (b) I got tests for that! :p
Good Luck!

1) In addition to the 'don't get too clever rule', please try to be precise when making your doctests; [1,2] may fail where [1, 2] may succeed. Likewise, ">>>function(x)" may fail where ">>> function(x)" is likely to suceed *(note the difference is single " " character)*. In short, if you fail a test the first thing to check is that you dont have any unecessary characters/spaces and/or odd formating.

2) As you shall see from the kata discussion testing for None is tricky and lots of people are struggling to get None tests working. So I'm going to quickly show you a way to test for not that will (should) pass the kata:
  
    def is_string(string):
          """
          returns the string if the string is Not empty, otherwise returns None
          >>> is_string("") is None
          True
          """
          return string if string else None

3) If you happen to be struggling to actually complete the three functions in the first place then I would recomend you google *"Python Indexing", "Pythons sum function" and "if/else statements in Python"*.

Sheep return in groups both of the days -> You will be given two arrays with these numbers (one for Friday and one for Saturday night). Array entries are integers, equal zero or higher - in case a given array is empty, farmer did not count the sheep or got sick (we treat this as no sheep returned that night).
Farmer knows how many sheep he has in total (third parameter). You need to calculate the amount of sheep lost (not returned to the farm) after final sheep count on Saturday.

Story
Bear the Freelancer charges clients on the hour, but he adjusts his rate depending on how close friends he is with his clients. For close friends, he charges $25 per hour, for his other friends he charges $50, for his acquaintances his hourly rate is $100, reaching $125 for all his other clients.
Input
You’ll receive a list of lists, representing all the jobs Bear the Freelancer carried out for the month. Each array within the outer list is comprised of the number of hours worked, and the proximity to the client as a string, the possible values being 'Close Friend', 'Friend', 'Acquaintance', or any other string for the rest of his clients. The recognition of those three strings ('Close Friend', 'Friend', and 'Acquaintance') should be case insensitive.
Example
[[10, 'Close Friend'], [3, 'Acquaintance'], [7, 'Lead from web'], [6, 'Friend'], [2, 'From advertisements']]

In this example, he'll be charging 10 hours at $25, 3 hours at $100, 7 hours at $125, 6 hours at $50, and 2 hours at $125, for a total of $1975.
Expected Output
The total amount of dollars Bear the Freelancer has invoiced for his work. For an empty array, return 0.

Задача:
In this exercise, you will create a function that takes an integer, i. With it you must do the following:

Find all of its multiples up to and including 100,

Then take the digit sum of each multiple (eg. 45 -> 4 + 5 = 9),

And finally, get the total sum of each new digit sum.


Note: If the digit sum of a number is more than 9 (eg. 99 -> 9 + 9 = 18) then you do NOT have to break it down further until it reaches one digit.
Example (if i is 25):
Multiples of 25 up to 100 --> [25, 50, 75, 100]
Digit sum of each multiple --> [7, 5, 12, 1]
Sum of each new digit sum --> 25
If you can, try writing it in readable code.

Задача:
Task
 You are given a moment in time and space. What you must do is break it down into time and space, to determine if that moment is from the past, present or future.
 Time is the sum of characters that increase time (i.e. numbers in range ['1'..'9'].
 Space in the number of characters which do not increase time (i.e. all characters but those that increase time).
 The moment of time is determined as follows:
 If time is greater than space, then the moment is from the future. If time is less than space, then the moment is from the past. Otherwise, it is the present moment.
 You should return an array of three elements, two of which are false, and one is true. The true value should be at the 1st, 2nd or 3rd place for past, present and future respectively.
Examples
 For moment = "01:00 pm", the output should be [true, false, false].
 time equals 1, and space equals 7, so the moment is from the past.
 For moment = "12:02 pm", the output should be [false, true, false].
 time equals 5, and space equals 5, which means that it's a present moment.
 For moment = "12:30 pm", the output should be [false, false, true].
 time equals 6, space equals 5, so the moment is from the future.
Input/Output

[input] string moment

  The moment of time and space that the input time came from.

[output] a boolean array

  Array of three elements, two of which are false, and one is true. The true value should be at the 1st, 2nd or 3rd place for past, present and future respectively.

After a long night (work, play, study) you find yourself sleeping on a bench in a park. As you wake up and try to figure out what happened you start counting trees.
You notice there are different tree sizes but there's always one size which is unbalanced. For example there are 2 size 2, 2 size 1 and 1 size 3. (then the size 3 is unbalanced)
Given an array representing different tree sizes. Which one is the unbalanced size.
Notes
There can be any number of sizes but one is always unbalanced
The unbalanced size is always one less than the other sizes
The array is not ordered (nor the trees)

Examples
For trees = [1,1,2,2,3], the result should be 3.
For trees = [2,2,2,56,56,56,8,8], the result should be 8.
For trees = [34,76,12,99,64,99,76,12,34], the result should be 64.
Input/Output

[input] integer array trees
Array representing different tree sizes

[output] an integer
The size of the missing tree.

Задача:
This kata honors a recurring troupe of many online games.The origin of this tradition can be traced to the classic Black Isle pc game Baldur's Gate. The very first quest requires you to kill 10 rats. One rather humble start for what later becomes a epic adventure. Honor awaits!
Its intended to be a easy but entertaining exercise on classes and conditions.
You must instantiate and interact with a World() object. On this kata the following methods are available:  
talk(target, what): Interact with npcs. The only valid npc on this kata has the name "npc".pickup(what): Pickup a thing to throw. Default is "rock".throw(target): If you are holding a thing, throw it at a target. The throw may miss. Will return True if hit, False if missed.  
Ex.:world.talk("npc", "hello")world.pickup("rock")world.throw("rat") 
Talking to the "npc" will give you further instructions on what to do. The talk replies will be in the Output panel. Be careful when using while loops because if the script timeouts you wont see any output.  
Your function should return the world object instance after all tasks are completed.The tests will call the done() method on the returned object. This method will check the internal flags of the object to see if you completed the quest line.Replacing or changing the World class and instance (other than calling the documented methods) is not allowed. The full tests include a few type checks.

Your function should return the world object instance after all tasks are completed.The tests will call the done() method on the returned object. This method will check the internal flags of the object to see if you completed the quest line.Replacing or changing the World class and instance (other than calling the documented methods) is not allowed. The full tests include a few type checks.

Задача:
This kata honors a recurring troupe of many online games.The origin of this tradition can be traced to the classic Black Isle pc game Baldur's Gate. The very first quest requires you to kill 10 rats. One rather humble start for what later becomes a epic adventure. Honor awaits!
Its intended to be a easy but entertaining exercise on classes and conditions.
You must instantiate and interact with a World() object. On this kata the following methods are available:  
talk(target, what): Interact with npcs. The only valid npc on this kata has the name "npc".pickup(what): Pickup a thing to throw. Default is "rock".throw(target): If you are holding a thing, throw it at a target. The throw may miss. Will return True if hit, False if missed.

Задача:
Task
 You are implementing a command-line version of the Paint app. Since the command line doesn't support colors, you are using different characters to represent pixels. Your current goal is to support rectangle x1 y1 x2 y2 operation, which draws a rectangle that has an upper left corner at (x1, y1) and a lower right corner at (x2, y2). Here the x-axis points from left to right, and the y-axis points from top to bottom.
 Given the initial canvas state and the array that represents the coordinates of the two corners, return the canvas state after the operation is applied. For the details about how rectangles are painted, see the example.
Example
 For
canvas = [['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'],
            ['a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a', 'a'],

Задача:
Task
 Your Informatics teacher at school likes coming up with new ways to help you understand the material. When you started studying numeral systems, he introduced his own numeral system, which he's convinced will help clarify things. His numeral system has base 26, and its digits are represented by English capital letters - A for 0, B for 1, and so on.
 The teacher assigned you the following numeral system exercise: given a one-digit number, you should find all unordered pairs of one-digit numbers whose values add up to the number.
Example
 For number = 'G', the output should be ["A + G", "B + F", "C + E", "D + D"]
 Translating this into the decimal numeral system we get: number = 6, so it is ["0 + 6", "1 + 5", "2 + 4", "3 + 3"].
Input/Output

[input] string(char in C#) number
A character representing a correct one-digit number in the new numeral system.
Constraints: 'A' ≤ number ≤ 'Z'.

[output] a string array
An array of strings in the format "letter1 + letter2", where "letter1" and "letter2" are correct one-digit numbers in the new numeral system. The strings should be sorted by "letter1".
Note that "letter1 + letter2" and "letter2 + letter1" are equal pairs and we don't consider them to be different.

 We want to turn the given integer into a number that has only one non-zero digit using a tail rounding approach. This means that at each step we take the last non 0 digit of the number and round it to 0 or to 10. If it's less than 5 we round it to 0 if it's larger than or equal to 5 we round it to 10 (rounding to 10 means increasing the next significant digit by 1). The process stops immediately once there is only one non-zero digit left.
Example
 For value = 15, the output should be 20
 For value = 1234, the output should be 1000.

Задача:
Task
 We want to turn the given integer into a number that has only one non-zero digit using a tail rounding approach. This means that at each step we take the last non 0 digit of the number and round it to 0 or to 10. If it's less than 5 we round it to 0 if it's larger than or equal to 5 we round it to 10 (rounding to 10 means increasing the next significant digit by 1). The process stops immediately once there is only one non-zero digit left.
Example
 For value = 15, the output should be 20
 For value = 1234, the output should be 1000.
 1234 -> 1230 -> 1200 -> 1000.

This kata is part of the collection Mary's Puzzle Books.
Mary brought home a "spot the differences" book. The book is full of a bunch of problems, and each problem consists of two strings that are similar. However, in each string there are a few characters that are different. An example puzzle from her book is:
String 1: "abcdefg"
String 2: "abcqetg"

Notice how the "d" from String 1 has become a "q" in String 2, and "f" from String 1 has become a "t" in String 2.
It's your job to help Mary solve the puzzles. Write a program spot_diff/Spot that will compare the two strings and return a list with the positions where the two strings differ. In the example above, your program should return [3, 5] because String 1 is different from String 2 at positions 3 and 5.
NOTES:
• If both strings are the same, return []
• Both strings will always be the same length
• Capitalization and punctuation matter

Задача:
The "Russian Peasant Method" is an old algorithm used by Russian peasants (and before them ancient Egyptians) to perform multiplication.  Consider that X and Y are two numbers.  X can be any number but Y must be a positive integer. To multiply X and Y:

Let the product = 0
If Y is odd, then the product = product + X
X = X + X
Y = integer part of Y / 2 
if Y is nonzero, repeat from step 2; otherwise the algorithm terminates and returns the product.

For example:
Let X = 10
Let Y = 5
X: 10 20 40 80
Y: 5  2  1  0
product = 10 + 40 = 50

You'll be given a string of characters as an input. Complete the function that returns a list of strings: 
(a) in the reverse order of the original string, and 
(b) with each successive string starting one character further in from the end of the original string.  
Assume the original string is at least 3 characters long.  Try to do this using slices and avoid converting the string to a list.
Examples
'123'   ==>  ['321', '21', '1']
'abcde' ==>  ['edcba', 'dcba', 'cba', 'ba', 'a']

Задача:
As a member of the editorial board of the prestigous scientific Journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, you've decided to go back and review how well old articles you've published stand up to modern publication best practices. Specifically, you'd like to re-evaluate old findings in light of recent literature about "researcher degrees of freedom".
You want to categorize all the old articles into three groups: "Fine", "Needs review" and "Pants on fire".
In order to categorize them you've enlisted an army of unpaid grad students to review and give you two data points from each study: (1) the p-value behind the paper's primary conclusions, and (2) the number of recommended author requirements to limit researcher degrees of freedom the authors satisfied:
* Authors must decide the rule for terminating data collection before data collection begins and report this rule in the article.
* Authors must collect at least 20 observations per cell or else provide a compelling cost-of-data-collection justification. 
* Authors must list all variables collected in a study.
* Authors must report all experimental conditions, including failed manipulations.
* If observations are eliminated, authors must also report what the statistical results are if those observations are included.
* If an analysis includes a covariate, authors must report the statistical results of the analysis without the covariate.

Your army of tenure-hungry grad students will give you the p-value as a float between 1.0 and 0.0 exclusive, and the number of author requirements satisfied as an integer from 0 through 6 inclusive.
You've decided to write a function, categorize_study() to automatically categorize each study based on these two inputs using the completely scientifically legitimate "bs-factor". The bs-factor for a particular paper is calculated as follows:

bs-factor when the authors satisfy all six requirements is 1
bs-factor when the authors satisfy only five requirements is 2
bs-factor when the authors satisfy only four requirements is 4
bs-factor when the authors satisfy only three requirements is 8...

Your function should multiply the p-value by the bs-factor and use that product to return one of the following strings:

product is less than 0.05: "Fine"
product is 0.05 to 0.15: "Needs review"
product is 0.15 or higher: "Pants on fire"

You've also decided that all studies meeting none of the author requirements that would have been categorized as "Fine" should instead be categorized as "Needs review".
For example:
categorize_study(0.01, 3) should return "Needs review" because the p-value times the bs-factor is 0.08.
categorize_study(0.04, 6) should return "Fine" because the p-value times the bs-factor is only 0.04.
categorize_study(0.0001, 0) should return "Needs review" even though the p-value times the bs-factor is only 0.0064.
categorize_study(0.012, 0) should return "Pants on fire" because the p-value times the bs-factor is 0.768.

Your army of tenure-hungry grad students will give you the p-value as a float between 1.0 and 0.0 exclusive, and the number of author requirements satisfied as an integer from 0 through 6 inclusive.
You've decided to write a function, categorize_study() to automatically categorize each study based on these two inputs using the completely scientifically legitimate "bs-factor". The bs-factor for a particular paper is calculated as follows:

bs-factor when the authors satisfy all six requirements is 1
bs-factor when the authors satisfy only five requirements is 2
bs-factor when the authors satisfy only four requirements is 4
bs-factor when the authors satisfy only three requirements is 8...

Your function should multiply the p-value by the bs-factor and use that product to return one of the following strings:

product is less than 0.05: "Fine"
product is 0.05 to 0.15: "Needs review"
product is 0.15 or higher: "Pants on fire"

You've also decided that all studies meeting none of the author requirements that would have been categorized as "Fine" should instead be categorized as "Needs review".
For example:
categorize_study(0.01, 3) should return "Needs review" because the p-value times the bs-factor is 0.08.
categorize_study(0.04, 6) should return "Fine" because the p-value times the bs-factor is only 0.04.
categorize_study(0.0001, 0) should return "Needs review" even though the p-value times the bs-factor is only 0.0064.
categorize_study(0.012, 0) should return "Pants on fire" because the p-value times the bs-factor is 0.768.

Задача:
Remember all those quadratic equations you had to solve by hand in highschool? Well, no more! You're going to solve all the quadratic equations you might ever[1] have to wrangle with in the future once and for all by coding up the quadratic formula to handle them automatically.
Write a function quadratic_formula() that takes three arguments, a, b, and c that represent the coefficients in a formula of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Your function shoud return a list with two elements where each element is one of the two roots. If the formula produces a double root the result should be a list where both elements are that value.
For example, quadratic_formula(2, 16, 1) should return the list [-0.06299606299409444, -7.937003937005906].
The order of the roots is not important.
[1] Well, not ever ever. You don't need to worry about getting quadratic equations with complex roots where you need the square root of a negative number. All the test cases will be for equations with real roots.

Task:
Your job here is to implement a method, approx_root in Ruby/Python/Crystal and approxRoot in JavaScript/CoffeeScript, that takes one argument, n, and returns the approximate square root of that number, rounded to the nearest hundredth and computed in the following manner.

Start with n = 213 (as an example). 
To approximate the square root of n, we will first find the greatest perfect square that is below or equal to n. (In this example, that would be 196, or 14 squared.) We will call the square root of this number (which means sqrt 196, or 14) base.
Then, we will take the lowest perfect square that is greater than or equal to n. (In this example, that would be 225, or 15 squared.)
Next, subtract 196 (greatest perfect square less than or equal to n) from n. (213 - 196 = 17) We will call this value diff_gn.
Find the difference between the lowest perfect square greater than or equal to n and the greatest perfect square less than or equal to n. (225 – 196 = 29) We will call this value diff_lg.
Your final answer is base + (diff_gn / diff_lg). In this example: 14 + (17 / 29) which is 14.59, rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Just to clarify, if the input is a perfect square itself, you should return the exact square of the input.
In case you are curious, the approximation (computed like above) for 213 rounded to four decimal places is 14.5862. The actual square root of 213 is 14.5945. 
Inputs will always be positive whole numbers. If you are having trouble understanding it, let me know with a comment, or take a look at the second group of the example cases.
Some examples:
approx_root(400) #=> 20
approx_root(401) #=> 
  # smallest perfect square above 401 is 441 or 21 squared
  # greatest perfect square below 401 is 400 or 20 squared

  # difference between 401 and 400 is 1

To approximate the square root of n, we will first find the greatest perfect square that is below or equal to n. (In this example, that would be 196, or 14 squared.) We will call the square root of this number (which means sqrt 196, or 14) base.
Then, we will take the lowest perfect square that is greater than or equal to n. (In this example, that would be 225, or 15 squared.)
Next, subtract 196 (greatest perfect square less than or equal to n) from n. (213 - 196 = 17) We will call this value diff_gn.
Find the difference between the lowest perfect square greater than or equal to n and the greatest perfect square less than or equal to n. (225 – 196 = 29) We will call this value diff_lg.
Your final answer is base + (diff_gn / diff_lg). In this example: 14 + (17 / 29) which is 14.59, rounded to the nearest hundredth.

Just to clarify, if the input is a perfect square itself, you should return the exact square of the input.
In case you are curious, the approximation (computed like above) for 213 rounded to four decimal places is 14.5862. The actual square root of 213 is 14.5945. 
Inputs will always be positive whole numbers. If you are having trouble understanding it, let me know with a comment, or take a look at the second group of the example cases.
Some examples:
approx_root(400) #=> 20
approx_root(401) #=> 
  # smallest perfect square above 401 is 441 or 21 squared
  # greatest perfect square below 401 is 400 or 20 squared
  # difference between 441 and 400 is 41
  # difference between 401 and 400 is 1
  # answer is 20 + (1 / 41) which becomes 20.02, rounded to the nearest hundredth

Prerequisites
This Kata assumes that you are already familiar with the idea of a linked list.  If you do not know what that is, you may want to read this article on Wikipedia.  Specifically, the linked lists this Kata is referring to are singly linked lists, where the value of a specific node is stored in its data / $data / Data property, the reference to the next node is stored in its next / $next / Next / next_node property and the terminator for a list is null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null().
Task
Create a function stringify which accepts an argument list / $list and returns a string representation of the list.  The string representation of the list starts with the value of the current Node, specified by its data / $data / Data property, followed by a whitespace character, an arrow and another whitespace character (" -> "), followed by the rest of the list.  The end of the string representation of a list must always end with null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null() ( all caps or all lowercase depending on the language you are undertaking this Kata in ).  For example, given the following list:
&((Node){
  .data = 1,
  .next = &((Node){
    .data = 2,
    .next = &((Node){
      .data = 3,
      .next = NULL
    })
  })
})

new Node(1, new Node(2, new Node(3)))

... its string representation would be:
"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> null"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> NULL"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> NULL"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> None"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> nil"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> nullptr"

@"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> NULL"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> null()"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> +nil+"

       "0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> NULL"

Note that null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null() itself is also considered a valid linked list.  In that case, its string representation would simply be "null" / "NULL" / "None" / "nil" / "nullptr" / @"NULL" / "null()" ( again, depending on the language ).
For the simplicity of this Kata, you may assume that any Node in this Kata may only contain non-negative integer values.  For example, you will not encounter a Node whose data / $data / Data property is "Hello World".

Prerequisites
This Kata assumes that you are already familiar with the idea of a linked list.  If you do not know what that is, you may want to read this article on Wikipedia.  Specifically, the linked lists this Kata is referring to are singly linked lists, where the value of a specific node is stored in its data / $data / Data property, the reference to the next node is stored in its next / $next / Next / next_node property and the terminator for a list is null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null().
Task
Create a function stringify which accepts an argument list / $list and returns a string representation of the list.  The string representation of the list starts with the value of the current Node, specified by its data / $data / Data property, followed by a whitespace character, an arrow and another whitespace character (" -> "), followed by the rest of the list.  The end of the string representation of a list must always end with null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null() ( all caps or all lowercase depending on the language you are undertaking this Kata in ).  For example, given the following list:
&((Node){
  .data = 1,
  .next = &((Node){
    .data = 2,
    .next = &((Node){
      .data = 3,

Prerequisites
This Kata assumes that you are already familiar with the idea of a linked list.  If you do not know what that is, you may want to read this article on Wikipedia.  Specifically, the linked lists this Kata is referring to are singly linked lists, where the value of a specific node is stored in its data / $data / Data property, the reference to the next node is stored in its next / $next / Next / next_node property and the terminator for a list is null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null().
Task
Create a function stringify which accepts an argument list / $list and returns a string representation of the list.  The string representation of the list starts with the value of the current Node, specified by its data / $data / Data property, followed by a whitespace character, an arrow and another whitespace character (" -> "), followed by the rest of the list.  The end of the string representation of a list must always end with null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null() ( all caps or all lowercase depending on the language you are undertaking this Kata in ).  For example, given the following list:
&((Node){
  .data = 1,
  .next = &((Node){
    .data = 2,
    .next = &((Node){
      .data = 3,
      .next = NULL
    })
  })
})

new Node(1, new Node(2, new Node(3)))

new Node(1, new Node(2, new Node(3)))

new Node(1, new Node(2, new Node(3)))

Node(1, Node(2, Node(3)))

new Node(1, new Node(2, new Node(3)))

Node.new(1, Node.new(2, Node.new(3)))

new Node(1, new Node(2, new Node(3)))

[1,2,3]

&((Node){
  .data = 1,
  .next = &((Node){
    .data = 2,
    .next = &((Node){
      .data = 3,
      .next = NULL
    })
  })
})

type(Node), pointer :: oneTwoThree

! oneTwoThree%data == 1
! oneTwoThree%next%data == 2
! oneTwoThree%next%next%data == 3
! oneTwoThree%next%next%next => null()

       set nxt of node2 to address of node3
       set nxt of node3 to address of node4
       set nxt of node4 to address of node5

... its string representation would be:
"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> null"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> NULL"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> NULL"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> None"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> nil"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> nullptr"

@"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> NULL"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> null()"

"0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> +nil+"

       "0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 9 -> 16 -> NULL"

Note that null / NULL / None / nil / nullptr / null() itself is also considered a valid linked list.  In that case, its string representation would simply be "null" / "NULL" / "None" / "nil" / "nullptr" / @"NULL" / "null()" ( again, depending on the language ).
For the simplicity of this Kata, you may assume that any Node in this Kata may only contain non-negative integer values.  For example, you will not encounter a Node whose data / $data / Data property is "Hello World".

Задача:
You will be given an array of objects (associative arrays in PHP, tables in COBOL) representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.
Your task is to return either:

true if all developers in the list code in the same language; or
false otherwise.

For example, given the following input array:
var list1 = [
  { firstName: 'Daniel', lastName: 'J.', country: 'Aruba', continent: 'Americas', age: 42, language: 'JavaScript' },
  { firstName: 'Kseniya', lastName: 'T.', country: 'Belarus', continent: 'Europe', age: 22, language: 'JavaScript' },

              05 Language     pic a(10) value 'JavaScript'.

your function should return true.
Notes:

The strings representing a given language will always be formatted in the same way (e.g. 'JavaScript' will always be formatted will upper-case 'J' and 'S' 
The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.





This kata is part of the Coding Meetup series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like: forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex. Other approaches to solving the katas are of course possible.

Задача:
You will be given an array of objects (associative arrays in PHP, tables in COBOL) representing data about developers who have signed up to attend the next coding meetup that you are organising.
Your task is to return either:

true if all developers in the list code in the same language; or
false otherwise.

For example, given the following input array:
var list1 = [
  { firstName: 'Daniel', lastName: 'J.', country: 'Aruba', continent: 'Americas', age: 42, language: 'JavaScript' },
  { firstName: 'Kseniya', lastName: 'T.', country: 'Belarus', continent: 'Europe', age: 22, language: 'JavaScript' },
  { firstName: 'Hanna', lastName: 'L.', country: 'Hungary', continent: 'Europe', age: 65, language: 'JavaScript' },
];

$list1 = [
  [
    "first_name" => "Daniel",
    "last_name" => "J.",
    "country" => "Aruba",
    "continent" => "Americas",
    "age" => 42,

your function should return true.
Notes:

The strings representing a given language will always be formatted in the same way (e.g. 'JavaScript' will always be formatted will upper-case 'J' and 'S' 
The input array will always be valid and formatted as in the example above.





This kata is part of the Coding Meetup series which includes a number of short and easy to follow katas which have been designed to allow mastering the use of higher-order functions. In JavaScript this includes methods like: forEach, filter, map, reduce, some, every, find, findIndex. Other approaches to solving the katas are of course possible.
Here is the full list of the katas in the Coding Meetup series:
Coding Meetup #1 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Count the number of JavaScript developers coming from Europe
Coding Meetup #2 - Higher-Order Functions Series - Greet developers

HINT: There are two cases to consider. Will it be the cylinder's height or the cylinder's radius that determines the maximum size of your cube? An if/else statement might be useful here.
Two Examples
1. for height  3, radius 7 => should return  27.0
2. for height 11, radius 5 => should return 353.55

Задача:
Congratulations! That Special Someone has given you their phone number.
But WAIT, is it a valid number? 
Your task is to write a function that verifies whether a given string contains a valid British mobile (cell) phone number or not. 
If valid, return 'In with a chance'.
If invalid, or if you're given an empty string, return 'Plenty more fish in the sea'.
A number can be valid in the following ways: 
Here in the UK mobile numbers begin with '07' followed by 9 other digits, e.g. '07454876120'.
Sometimes the number is preceded by the country code, the prefix '+44', which replaces the '0' in ‘07’, e.g. '+447454876120'.
And sometimes you will find numbers with dashes in-between digits or on either side, e.g. '+44--745---487-6120' or '-074-54-87-61-20-'. As you can see, dashes may be consecutive. 
Good Luck Romeo/Juliette!

Задача:
Don't give me five!
In this kata you get the start number and the end number of a region and should return the count of all numbers except numbers with a 5 in it. The start and the end number are both inclusive!
Examples:
1,9 -> 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9 -> Result 8
4,17 -> 4,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,16,17 -> Result 12

The result may contain fives. ;-)
The start number will always be smaller than the end number. Both numbers can be also negative!
I'm very curious for your solutions and the way you solve it. Maybe someone of you will find an easy pure mathematics solution.
Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-) 
I have also created other katas. Take a look if you enjoyed this kata!
